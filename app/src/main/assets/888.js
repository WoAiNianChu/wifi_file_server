"    \"content\": \"        \\n## 编写整洁代码的原则\\n\\n1. Think About the Big Picture\\n2. Stand on the Shoulders of Giants\\n3. Code for People, Not Machines\\n\\n    You may think that the primary purpose of a piece of source code is to define what machines should do and how they should do it.\\n\\n    Not so.\\n\\n    The single purpose of a programming language such as Python is to help humans write code.\\n\\n    Compilers do the heavy lifting and translate your high-level code to low-level code that is understandable by your machine.\\n\\n    Yes, your code will eventually be run by a machine.\\n\\n    But code is still written mainly by humans, and in today’s software development process, the code likely must pass many levels of human judgment before it is deployed.\\n\\n    First and foremost, you’re writing code for people, not machines.\\n\\n4. Use the Right Names\\n\\n    Relatedly, experienced coders have often agreed on a set of specific naming conventions for functions, function arguments, objects, methods, and variables, both implicit and explicit.\\n\\n    Everybody benefits from adhering to these conventions: code becomes more readable, easier to understand, and less cluttered.\\n\\n    If you violate these conventions, readers of your code are likely to assume that it was written by an inexperienced programmer and may not take your code seriously.\\n\\n5. Adhere to Standards and Be Consistent\\n\\n    Every programming language comes with an implicit or explicit set of rules on how to write clean code.\\n\\n    If you are an active coder, these standards will always catch up with you eventually.\\n\\n    However, you can speed the process by taking the time to study the code standard of the programming language you’re learning.\\n\\n6. Use Comments\\n7. Avoid Unnecessary Comments\\n\\n\\tThat said, not all comments help readers understand code better.\\n\\n\\tIn some cases, comments actually reduce clarity and confuse the readers of a codebase.\\n\\n\\tTo write clean code, you should not only use valuable comments but also avoid unnecessary comments.\\n    \\n8. The Principle of Least Surprise\\n\\n\\tThe principle of least surprise states that a component of a system should behave in the way most users expect it to behave.\\n\\n\\tThis principle is one of the golden rules when designing effective applications and user experience.\\n\\n9. Don’t Repeat Yourself\\n\\n\\tDon’t repeat yourself (DRY) is a widely recognized principle that recommends, intuitively enough, avoiding repetitive code.\\n\\n10. Single Responsibility Principle\\n\\n\\tThe single responsibility principle means that every function should have one main task.\\n\\n\\tIt’s better to use many small functions than one big function accomplishing everything at the same time.\\n\\n\\tThe encapsulation of functionality reduces the overall code complexity.\\n\\n11. Test\\n12. Small Is Beautiful\\n\\n\\tSmall code is code that requires only a relatively small number of lines to accomplish a single specified task.\\n\\n13. The Law of Demeter\\n\\n\\thttps://ccs.neu.edu/home/lieber/what-is-demeter.html\\n    \\n14. You Ain’t Gonna Need It\\n\\n\\tThis principle suggests that you should never implement code if you only suspect that you’ll need to use it someday in the future—because you ain’t gonna need it! Write code only if you’re 100 percent sure it’s necessary.\\n\\n\\tCode for today’s needs and not tomorrow’s.\\n\\n15. Don’t Use Too Many Levels of Indentation\\n16. Use Metrics\\n17. Boy Scout Rule and Refactoring \\n\\n\\tThe boy scout rule is simple: leave the campground cleaner than you found it.\\n\\n\\n## 书籍 \\n\\nThe Art of Clean Code\\n\\n## 更多\",\n" +

right field for me.\\n\\n116\\n00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,880\\nEventually, I found my knees and demographics.\\n\\n117\\n00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,160\\nIt's much more precise with clear cut

The real mantra of Yeah.\\n\\n139\\n00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,120\\nThat's what I'm almost product guy.\\n\\n140\\n00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:42,880\\nThe question is, is it genetics or is it lifestyle being?\\n\\n141\\n00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,560\\nPeople in Costa Rica say probably the good I me, the.\\n\\n142\\n00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,160\\nAnd think I used to joke most of it.\\n\\n143\\n00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:03,480\\nWe carried out a study to see what happens when people leave Nicoya and what happens when people from other parts of the country move to Nicoya.\\n\\n144\\n00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:08,280\\nParties in price of evicting Nicoya we must get.\\n\\n145\\n00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:14,920\\nWe found out that neither of these groups achieved the same longevity as those who are born and spend their whole lives here.\\n\\n146\\n00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,000\\nEven on three, ten, 20.\\n\\n147\\n00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,320\\nIn blue zones, eating seems to proceed more slowly.\\n\\n148\\n00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,440\\nThan people come from.\\n\\n149\\n00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,720\\nThe environment and the lifestyle appear to positively impact human biology.\\n\\n150\\n00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,280\\nFor me.\\n\\n151\\n00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:55,320\\nBut how exactly and will this help us crack the aging code?\\n\\n152\\n00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,480\\nI'm molecular biologist, biochemist.\\n\\n153\\n00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,760\\nI'm interested in understanding the origin of diseases.\\n\\n154\\n00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,480\\nThe majority of diseases are those associated with the aging process.\\n\\n155\\n00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,920\\nSo I'm interested in understanding why we age the molecular level.\\n\\n156\\n00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,880\\nI wanted to devote my life to understand the origins of cancer on aging.\\n\\n157\\n00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,880\\nI thought telomerase could be the key.\\n\\n158\\n00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:26,280\\nThe human body consists of around 37 trillion cells, some last a few days.\\n\\n159\\n00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,240\\nOthers live for years.\\n\\n160\\n00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,920\\nWe constantly produce new cells to replace the old ones.\\n\\n161\\n00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:40,320\\nIt's a process that involves duplication.\\n\\n162\\n00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:46,280\\nBefore cell division can take place, the chromosomes in the cell nucleus have to be duplicated.\\n\\n163\\n00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,760\\nThe DNA double helix they consist of is unwound and separated into strands.\\n\\n164\\n00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,760\\nEach strand then becomes a template for a new one.\\n\\n165\\n00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:07,760\\nThe ends of the chromosomes, which are especially prone to replication errors, are protected by telomeres, which are sequences of non-coding DNA.\\n\\n166\\n00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:16,200\\nBut with every cell division, these safety caps become shorter and.\\n\\n167\\n00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:28,080\\nLess charged.\\n\\n168\\n00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:36,800\\nI feel charged with that.\\n\\n169\\n00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:45,040\\nThe issue of the telomeres.\\n\\n170\\n00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,280\\nImagine this shoelace is our chromosome.\\n\\n171\\n00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,280\\nSo this part of the shoelace is the DNA where the genetic information is.\\n\\n172\\n00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:58,560\\nAnd this little plastic part, which is very important to protect the shoelace would be the telomere.\\n\\n173\\n00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:04,920\\nSo the telomeres are very important to protect our chromosomes, to protect the DNA.\\n\\n174\\n00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,440\\nAs we age, the telomeres become shorter and shorter.\\n\\n175\\n00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:13,320\\nThis is because every time that we have a damage, the cells have to multiply to regenerate the damage.\\n\\n176\\n00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,000\\nAnd this shortens the delivers to the cell division of the cell multiplication.\\n\\n177\\n00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,840\\nSo at the end, the telomeres become so short that we don't have any more active them.\\n\\n178\\n00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:33,480\\nSo now our DNA is unprotected and this is leading to aging, is leading to disease, and ultimately will be leading to this cell division.\\n\\n179\\n00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:45,320\\nAnd the rate of telomere shortening may be influenced by our lifestyle, smoking, stress, environmental pollutants and poor nutrition are all negative factors.\\n\\n180\\n00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:54,120\\nSome researchers believe living in harmony with the natural world has a positive effect.\\n\\n181\\n00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,760\\nYou know, Sartre's sucking.\\n\\n182\\n00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:01,520\\nWe couldn't carry out experiments like this in Costa Rica, so we sent our samples away.\\n\\n183\\n00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:06,160\\nWhen the results of this collaboration came back, we realized we'd found something.\\n\\n184\\n00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,440\\nLost in a similar anarchy.\\n\\n185\\n00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:07,840\\nOkay.\\n\\n186\\n00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,040\\nAnd then contra las personas. Nicole.\\n\\n187\\n00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,800\\nKaya, DNA.\\n\\n188\\n00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:18,360\\nPeople from Nicoya have longer telomeres, significantly longer telomeres than people in the rest of the country.\\n\\n189\\n00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,400\\nThis tiny piece.\\n\\n190\\n00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:31,280\\nScientists like Maria Blasco are exploring ways of artificially lengthening telomeres in order to slow the aging process.\\n\\n191\\n00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,440\\nBut this does come at a risk.\\n\\n192\\n00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,120\\nTo your father by is does.\\n\\n193\\n00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:41,720\\nThe danger is that cancer can develop because cancer cells are immortal and we're walking a fine line here.\\n\\n194\\n00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,520\\nDo we tell the cells to resist their preprogramed cell death and risk that it will result in cancer?\\n\\n195\\n00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:54,800\\nOr do we leave things to run their natural course and let the cells die when their time is up and there's no proliferation?\\n\\n196\\n00:17:54,800 --> 00:18:00,360\\nAnd we just accept that our final destination is around 120 to 125 years.\\n\\n197\\n00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,400\\nOf unsuccessful, not from one scientist.\\n\\n198\\n00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,560\\nBut of course we all know the answer.\\n\\n199\\n00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:12,000\\nHumans want to test the boundaries and see if they can really live to 150 or 300 and.\\n\\n200\\n00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,640\\nHow far can we go?\\n\\n201\\n00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:30,280\\nHow much should science interfere in nature's blueprint?\\n\\n202\\n00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:36,720\\nWe don't have to necessarily accept current biological limitations because that's what we do as a species.\\n\\n203\\n00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,400\\nWe're problem solvers.\\n\\n204\\n00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,120\\nWe don't just sit around and get rained on, we build houses.\\n\\n205\\n00:18:42,760 --> 00:19:03,960\\nSo we may want to transcend normal biology at some point and set goals for ourself beyond just normal concepts of health.\\n\\n206\\n00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:10,440\\nWhen you wonder about what is aging, you end up asking how tissues repair.\\n\\n207\\n00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:16,400\\nThis is a process that is still poorly understood.\\n\\n208\\n00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:28,080\\nCells progressively accumulate damage they age, but when they reach a certain threshold, they undergo a switch.\\n\\n209\\n00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,680\\nThey become senescent.\\n\\n210\\n00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,600\\nI like to describe them as zombies because, you know, they're like in a middle stage between alive and dead.\\n\\n211\\n00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,080\\nThey're not either, but they're at the same time they're really damaging.\\n\\n212\\n00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:51,320\\nSenescent cells produce an alarm signal so that the other cells in the body realize that there is a damage there and they go and they repair.\\n\\n213\\n00:19:52,080 --> 00:20:00,160\\nThe problem is that as we get older, these repair says they are also old and they don't go and they don't repair.\\n\\n214\\n00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,960\\nAnd we accumulate these cells that are constantly producing this alarm.\\n\\n215\\n00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,440\\nThis is a phenomenon that is called inflammation.\\n\\n216\\n00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:22,440\\nAll people have inflammatory signals elevated caused by their own senescent cells that are not eliminated.\\n\\n217\\n00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:34,800\\nWe are trying to crack the code of these senescent cells, trying to understand their vulnerabilities, how to kill them without killing the non senescent cells.\\n\\n218\\n00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:41,720\\nIn some initial experiments, Manuel Serrano and his team were able to show that mice lived longer.\\n\\n219\\n00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,960\\nOnce they're senescent or zombie cells were eliminated.\\n\\n220\\n00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,600\\nBut that does not guarantee eternal youth.\\n\\n221\\n00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,600\\nIt's a double edged sword.\\n\\n222\\n00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:59,280\\nSenescent cells play also very good, an important role, for example, in wound healing.\\n\\n223\\n00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:04,240\\nIf you have a wound, if you don't have senescence, the wound will never hear.\\n\\n224\\n00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:10,160\\nSo you could have a treatment that removes all senescent cells and suddenly you have terrible side effects.\\n\\n225\\n00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,280\\nIt just means we need more research, you know.\\n\\n226\\n00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:21,240\\nResearch into telomeres and zombie cells are only two approaches in the race for longevity.\\n\\n227\\n00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:33,440\\nAnd one thing is certain whoever cracks the code is set to earn millions.\\n\\n228\\n00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:40,760\\nAll right, so, guys, how do I look?\\n\\n229\\n00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:45,440\\nDo I look old?\\n\\n230\\n00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,680\\nSo you've seen what we did.\\n\\n231\\n00:21:46,680 --> 00:22:04,680\\nWe've announced that $255 million raise is the largest raise in our industry to date.\\n\\n232\\n00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:13,960\\nHong Kong has the highest life expectancy on the planet today, which is no surprise because longevity is very often correlate it with wealth.\\n\\n233\\n00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,320\\nAnd here people are filthy rich.\\n\\n234\\n00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:28,760\\nWelfare is increasing dramatically in the region, in China, in mainland people who were peasants just 35 years ago, they are now multimillionaires.\\n\\n235\\n00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:39,480\\nAnd people demand longevity.\\n\\n236\\n00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:52,040\\nAs a CEO of a biotech company, I tried to collaborate with a lot of people and I tried to contribute as many projects as possible.\\n\\n237\\n00:22:52,040 --> 00:23:03,280\\nLife Clinic is a very fun concept where the founder is decided to bridge the Starbucks concept with preventative medical care.\\n\\n238\\n00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:15,240\\nYou choose a cocktail of all kinds of nutrients that will be going into your blood while you are sipping on a juice.\\n\\n239\\n00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,920\\nThey offer IV drips and all kinds of other interventions.\\n\\n240\\n00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,280\\nI cannot vouch for some of them, man.\\n\\n241\\n00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,520\\nYeah, I. Be. Correct.\\n\\n242\\n00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,360\\nCorrect.\\n\\n243\\n00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,720\\nIn Hong Kong? Correct.\\n\\n244\\n00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:36,400\\nAnything geared at increasing life expectancy already promises megabucks, dubious wonder.\\n\\n245\\n00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,240\\nDrugs and IV drips are readily available.\\n\\n246\\n00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,560\\nThe region is also attracting biotech companies from around the world.\\n\\n247\\n00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:59,040\\nMoney from wealthy investors has created a much hyped start up scene longevity research is Hong Kong's new dotcom boom.\\n\\n248\\n00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,640\\nAnd.\\n\\n249\\n00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:06,960\\nA new development is that the research is being carried out with business startup methods, with massive capital.\\n\\n250\\n00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:13,800\\nWe're investing or pumping funds into it, we're throwing cash at it, and that will invariably result in a product.\\n\\n251\\n00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,800\\nIt's an infallible economic model.\\n\\n252\\n00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,200\\nIt will always work. To.\\n\\n253\\n00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,920\\nReach a market.\\n\\n254\\n00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,440\\nThere's a huge market for these new companies.\\n\\n255\\n00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,160\\nOne really is to have treatments for for diseases.\\n\\n256\\n00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:32,680\\nSo that's where the big bucks are.\\n\\n257\\n00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:36,960\\nI'm willing to experiment on myself because there is a lot of data on me.\\n\\n258\\n00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:45,080\\nI'm one of the most well studied humans on the planet now, and I try to optimize for high performance at this point in time.\\n\\n259\\n00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,360\\nI try to perform at my peak.\\n\\n260\\n00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,320\\nI've tried rapamycin in the past.\\n\\n261\\n00:24:51,320 --> 00:25:03,720\\nIt's very often referred to as a magic drug in longevity, in not in the same line as metformin, but it's likely to be stronger than the form and it's not without side effects.\\n\\n262\\n00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,960\\nSo there is a chance that you are going to see Mucositis and a few others.\\n\\n263\\n00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:13,640\\nSo we decided to try it on ourself in a very controlled mode.\\n\\n264\\n00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,680\\nAny side effects?\\n\\n265\\n00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,080\\nNot at all. Zero side effects.\\n\\n266\\n00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,800\\nWhen I was exercising in the hotel, I got some serious muscle mass increases here.\\n\\n267\\n00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,600\\nIt's great.\\n\\n268\\n00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,800\\nI actually, as a cook.\\n\\n269\\n00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,920\\nAll right.\\n\\n270\\n00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,520\\nYeah, that's me.\\n\\n271\\n00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:37,040\\nSo that's for the rest of this.\\n\\n272\\n00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,520\\nOh, thank you. This.\\n\\n273\\n00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,000\\nThank you so much for coming here.\\n\\n274\\n00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,520\\nYes. Your whole life literally.\\n\\n275\\n00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,840\\nTo a life.\\n\\n276\\n00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:59,520\\nRapamycin, metformin, energy boosters.\\n\\n277\\n00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,600\\nDo any of these substances really help?\\n\\n278\\n00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:23,160\\nHow can their effectiveness be tested?\\n\\n279\\n00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:31,560\\nI was interested in anti-aging signs since I was a teenager growing up in Frankfurt, Germany.\\n\\n280\\n00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:42,000\\nI had a group of friends who were very interested in science, and at some point we realized the most important challenge of our generation is to prolong life.\\n\\n281\\n00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,480\\nWe had very lofty goals.\\n\\n282\\n00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,360\\nI need to tell you, you know, we have crazy goals.\\n\\n283\\n00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:53,640\\nWe wanted to study physics, math, biology, chemistry.\\n\\n284\\n00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,920\\nAlso, we wanted to do space travel.\\n\\n285\\n00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:06,360\\nAnd then the minute you think of space travel, you realize that you will need decades, you know, to travel for centuries.\\n\\n286\\n00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:19,200\\nAnd so we felt we really need to solve this problem first to extend our lifespan before we can even think about space travel one day by accident.\\n\\n287\\n00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,040\\nReally, because I did somebody a favor.\\n\\n288\\n00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,160\\nI analyze this methylation data.\\n\\n289\\n00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:31,800\\nI immediately recognized that epigenetics or methylation is really the data source that has a tremendous signal for aging.\\n\\n290\\n00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:41,240\\nHe was able to find clusters of genes whose methylation state could tell you how old you were at a particular time.\\n\\n291\\n00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:56,080\\nThe amazing thing about this is that it works from the day you're created as a fertilized egg cell all the way until the day that you die.\\n\\n292\\n00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:03,480\\nThere are more than 200 distinct cell types in the human body, although they all contain the same DNA.\\n\\n293\\n00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,760\\nThere is a mechanism that tells the cell whether it is a skin cell or a liver cell.\\n\\n294\\n00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:14,320\\nFor example, called epigenetics.\\n\\n295\\n00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:25,040\\nThis involves information that sits on the DNA resulting in genes being switched on or off.\\n\\n296\\n00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:35,640\\nPerhaps the best known type of epigenetic change is methylation, the addition or removal of methyl groups on the DNA strand.\\n\\n297\\n00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:41,600\\nThese changes continue to take place throughout our lives.\\n\\n298\\n00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,600\\nThe DNA contains four letters.\\n\\n299\\n00:28:43,600 --> 00:29:07,560\\nA CTG methylation sometimes attaches to the letter C and modifies it similar to an omelet by keeping track very carefully which parts of the DNA gain, methylation or lose methylation we can measure aging methylation can be sort of like the rust that accumulates.\\n\\n300\\n00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,040\\nBy measuring the amount of rust, we can determine age.\\n\\n301\\n00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:21,280\\nSo if we have an hourglass, the passage of time is measured by how the sand how much sand accumulates at the bottom.\\n\\n302\\n00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:28,880\\nThe DNA molecule, though, has 28 million different hourglass because we have 28 million.\\n\\n303\\n00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,440\\nLet us see in our DNA.\\n\\n304\\n00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:42,160\\nSo by averaging the measurements of 28 million hour glasses, you arrive at a very accurate measure of age.\\n\\n305\\n00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:47,320\\nThis is one of the most insightful discoveries in the history of mankind.\\n\\n306\\n00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,200\\nDoes we like the invention of the wheel?\\n\\n307\\n00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,040\\nWhat is.\\n\\n308\\n00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,200\\nThat? Definitely as a turning point in aging?\\n\\n309\\n00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:59,000\\nI think that was just a very, very important point where we realized, hey, we can measure aging now.\\n\\n310\\n00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:06,680\\nThe epigenetic clock has revolutionized research into aging with a simple DNA sample.\\n\\n311\\n00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:20,920\\nAnyone's biologic age can be determined, however, that can produce some nasty surprises.\\n\\n312\\n00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:30,040\\nMy name is Marcus Horvath, and I am Steve's identical twin brother is my older twin.\\n\\n313\\n00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:35,880\\nBrother is 5 minutes older than me, however, only at birth.\\n\\n314\\n00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:56,800\\nWe measured our epigenetic clock a couple of years ago, and then according to one of the clocks, I was actually four years older than him, which is not necessarily good news.\\n\\n315\\n00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:05,360\\nThose technologies are enabling us to accelerate aging research dramatically by not waiting until you die.\\n\\n316\\n00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,400\\nWe can now measure where you.\\n\\n317\\n00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,880\\nAre in life.\\n\\n318\\n00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:16,680\\nAnd measure how different interventions affect that prediction.\\n\\n319\\n00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:23,920\\nWe picked this up and applied a to the same problem and developed many, many Asian clocks.\\n\\n320\\n00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:28,800\\nAbove all, the quest for eternal life requires personal biological data.\\n\\n321\\n00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,600\\nThe digital devices we use every day can provide mountains of it.\\n\\n322\\n00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:39,240\\nBig data is currently one of the most promising approaches to cracking the aging code.\\n\\n323\\n00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:49,480\\nUnlike conventional medicine or artificial intelligence can scour the data for hidden patterns to help prevent diseases from developing in the first place.\\n\\n324\\n00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:54,480\\nThis situation looks very similar to fast on the subway.\\n\\n325\\n00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:03,080\\nSo when you pull your wallet and you don't know who, every human on the train looks the same.\\n\\n326\\n00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:03,840\\nThey move.\\n\\n327\\n00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:11,280\\nThey move in different patterns.\\n\\n328\\n00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:23,240\\nSo you need to observe many, many of those scenarios in many subways globally to develop a really precise algorithm for catching a thief on the subway.\\n\\n329\\n00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:31,120\\nAnd you train AI technologies to recognize those thieves and predict human behavior.\\n\\n330\\n00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:44,160\\nAnd I think nowadays in advanced countries like mainland China, there are video monitoring techniques that allow you automatically to recognize the fast movement.\\n\\n331\\n00:32:45,200 --> 00:33:01,320\\nSo it's very similar to recognize those proteins that misbehave during aging and cause trouble.\\n\\n332\\n00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:01,560\\nYeah.\\n\\n333\\n00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:06,600\\nSo what we are going to do now, we're going to solve a disease very quickly.\\n\\n334\\n00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,120\\nWe're going to solve the Crohn's disease.\\n\\n335\\n00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,840\\nA.I.\\n\\n336\\n00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:21,800\\nis already poised to increase our life expectancy, or so we're told, at the touch of a button.\\n\\n337\\n00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:40,400\\nStart ups can run through thousands of possible outcomes and quickly discover new medications, all based on data from users of apps like the one that Alex Zhavoronkov has developed.\\n\\n338\\n00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:47,040\\nWe recently received $255 million from a group of ultra elite investors.\\n\\n339\\n00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:54,040\\nSo it turned out that we are in the right place, in the right time, with the right technology.\\n\\n340\\n00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:57,080\\nI think that very soon we will see guys like Amazon.\\n\\n341\\n00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:21,000\\nI'm waiting for those guys to react, guys like Facebook, guys that produce video games, Netflix, those people who steal your time, they will come back and try to figure out how to make more time so you can wasted on their product.\\n\\n342\\n00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,640\\nSilicon Valley is already on board.\\n\\n343\\n00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:29,400\\nIn 2013, Google founded a secretive biotech venture called Calico.\\n\\n344\\n00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:35,960\\nIts longevity research is carried out behind closed doors with nearly unlimited resources.\\n\\n345\\n00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:50,840\\nA group backed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has also burst onto the anti-aging scene with hundreds of millions in funding Altos Labs is recruiting top scientists from around the globe to join the project.\\n\\n346\\n00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,360\\nThey include Steve Horvath and Manuel Serrano.\\n\\n347\\n00:34:54,920 --> 00:35:02,920\\nThere's even a longevity clinic in the pipeline.\\n\\n348\\n00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:18,360\\nDespite the big players jockeying for position, there are still opportunities for smaller projects like Startup Bio Biotin, which is working flat out to develop a self-test to measure aging.\\n\\n349\\n00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:27,760\\nBiotin is a group of people who are working towards the goal of extending healthspan and eradicating aging with its users.\\n\\n350\\n00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:33,760\\nWe're all just sort of a group of people with a sort of a fascination for age related diseases and aging itself.\\n\\n351\\n00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:37,800\\nWe have sort of focused on this idea of biological age itself.\\n\\n352\\n00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,120\\nWe tell you what your biological age is in sort of an accessible and cheap manner.\\n\\n353\\n00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,800\\nAnd a lot of biological age tests currently are very pricey, which is fine.\\n\\n354\\n00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:52,840\\nI mean, it makes total sense, especially for Biohackers and people who are way more interested in the very deep signs of aging.\\n\\n355\\n00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:58,440\\nBut we just want to give and general encapsulation of your aging process to the general population.\\n\\n356\\n00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:10,640\\nNina's clock is designed to determine age based on proteins in saliva, although she can only work in a lab once she turns 16, she's found ways to access the latest data.\\n\\n357\\n00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,640\\nGo to research paper website and they are supplementary files that we were able to download and see their data.\\n\\n358\\n00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,600\\nSo that's really cool.\\n\\n359\\n00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,800\\nSometimes when it comes to us working directly with labs, they send us the data personally.\\n\\n360\\n00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:32,280\\nThey tell us Here is the work we've done because it often helps them to in their projects.\\n\\n361\\n00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:41,320\\nYou know, people like Nina are taking advantage of a new paradigm, really, in which you can the data on your own data is available.\\n\\n362\\n00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,840\\nMy lab does that.\\n\\n363\\n00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:46,320\\nOn the one hand, I download data, but I also upload a lot of data.\\n\\n364\\n00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,160\\nI put millions of dollars worth of data into the public domain.\\n\\n365\\n00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:54,400\\nI think it's cool. Yeah, I think it's very cool.\\n\\n366\\n00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,760\\nActually.\\n\\n367\\n00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:59,600\\nI know you're making some progress on the image of the test recently and kind of have a good rendering.\\n\\n368\\n00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,520\\nAnd did you want to show your screen and show what that might look like?\\n\\n369\\n00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,360\\nYeah, I'll just do that right now.\\n\\n370\\n00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,240\\nHold on.\\n\\n371\\n00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:15,000\\nBasically right now, I think what we decided was the best way is like having a multi panel test with each corresponding to one protein.\\n\\n372\\n00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,240\\nWe're using the same technology used in pregnancy tests.\\n\\n373\\n00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,400\\nSo I think that's pretty interesting.\\n\\n374\\n00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,800\\nHe's spent on the test in the sample area.\\n\\n375\\n00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:31,560\\nThen from there, you downloaded sort of our app and from there you're able to find out, you know, the ratios of your control to sort of your protein line.\\n\\n376\\n00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:43,360\\nSo what is the concentration of these proteins and based on the color of this test, so you you scan this, you find out that information you entered into our website and you can find out more about your aging process.\\n\\n377\\n00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:51,520\\nWe want to do a subscription based you know, you're going to get several tests a year because, you know, it's slowly going to get better, as, you know, as you improve too.\\n\\n378\\n00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:56,760\\nSo it'll be really cool.\\n\\n379\\n00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:10,040\\nIt would be very hard to conceive even wanting to do that for me, and I don't think anybody here is going to sign up for it.\\n\\n380\\n00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:20,560\\nIn contrast to Nina, Ana, Gail Glen in Costa Rica has already ended her professional life.\\n\\n381\\n00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:25,320\\nA successful swimwear designer, she was able to retire at age 50.\\n\\n382\\n00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:31,880\\nEver since, she's been involved in a range of social projects.\\n\\n383\\n00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,320\\nIt's about being unified.\\n\\n384\\n00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,200\\nIt's about to participate and be of service.\\n\\n385\\n00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,160\\nYou know, do what you can care for yourself, but do what you can to care for others as well.\\n\\n386\\n00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:50,320\\nAnd hopefully you get to a point in life where your basic needs are being met well enough that you have plenty of time to care for others.\\n\\n387\\n00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:56,960\\nIt boils down to the question, you know, do I do I save myself or do I save my community?\\n\\n388\\n00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:02,520\\nAnd really, if your community doesn't survive, what kind of life are you going to have?\\n\\n389\\n00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:18,440\\nA couple of years ago, a law was passed to protect the longhairs or the centenarians of the area that we live in, which is considered a legal blue zone, legal, you know, by law in Costa Rica.\\n\\n390\\n00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:24,640\\nSo that's new.\\n\\n391\\n00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,800\\nNicoya is preparing for an increasing number of centenarians.\\n\\n392\\n00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:34,640\\nA private initiative aims raise funds to build the region's first nursing home.\\n\\n393\\n00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:41,640\\nRapid advances in longevity research are prompting a rethink of existing social structures.\\n\\n394\\n00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:55,040\\nWhat will our lives look like if we continue to grow older and older?\\n\\n395\\n00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,840\\nThe centenarians did their contribution.\\n\\n396\\n00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,600\\nNow it's somebody else's turn to take care of them.\\n\\n397\\n00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,960\\nOne of them when a diet on.\\n\\n398\\n00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,680\\nNicholas Weiner diet.\\n\\n399\\n00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,680\\nLiterally glows when we visit.\\n\\n400\\n00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:12,840\\nThe long heralds you ask them, How do you feel about this project we're doing?\\n\\n401\\n00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,640\\nWell are completely.\\n\\n402\\n00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,440\\nI'm going to be 103 years go by.\\n\\n403\\n00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,680\\nThat's great.\\n\\n404\\n00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,640\\nBut when you get old, you eventually need some help.\\n\\n405\\n00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:24,920\\nYou start.\\n\\n406\\n00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,200\\nThen you're lucky.\\n\\n407\\n00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,920\\nTo live with your daughter who looks after you.\\n\\n408\\n00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,440\\nThere are people who have no support or no.\\n\\n409\\n00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,840\\nFamily is there for you.

to grow older without turning to pills and injections that alter our DNA.\\n\\n426\\n00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:35,840\\nWell, in my personal opinion, I would not waste time on blue zones.\\n\\n427\\n00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,240\\nWe to fix the problem of aging right here, right now.\\n\\n428\\n00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:47,160\\nWe've reached a point of evolution where we need to accelerate evolution ourself.\\n\\n429\\n00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:51,240\\nTo do this, we need to evolve and we need to change as humans as well.\\n\\n430\\n00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:57,560\\nThe the lack of any other side.\\n\\n431\\n00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,400\\nThat nature has no plan.\\n\\n432\\n00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,440\\nNature is a random thing, right?\\n\\n433\\n00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,400\\nBut it works.\\n\\n434\\n00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,200\\nNature's built up life on this planet over the last four and a half billion years.\\n\\n435\\n00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:18,000\\nAnd it is fine tuned and honed and optimized thanks to an unbelievable able degree of perfection.\\n\\n436\\n00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:31,800\\nSo you have to be a little bit careful about messing with Mother Nature.\\n\\n437\\n00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,280\\nBut.\\n\\n438\\n00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:52,320\\nOne of the interesting things about super centenarians and centenarians is that their immune systems last much better than the rest of us, which is clue as to the fact that you need to have a good immune system in order to stay alive a long time.\\n\\n439\\n00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:04,360\\nSteve Horvath is one of the scientists set to follow the call of Amazon boss Jeff Bezos.\\n\\n440\\n00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:10,640\\nBut before he embarks on that new task, he's focusing on another promising project.\\n\\n441\\n00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:19,200\\nIt's the so-called trim trial designed by his colleague Greg Fahy to reverse immune system aging.\\n\\n442\\n00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:25,320\\nHardly any other study in the field has prompted as much interest in recent times.\\n\\n443\\n00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:31,400\\nThe flow of immune cells plays a central role in fighting illness in our bodies.\\n\\n444\\n00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:36,440\\nBut there's a limited supply of these essential cells.\\n\\n445\\n00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:43,080\\nOur bodies, thymus gland, produces t cells, the superstars of the adaptive immune system.\\n\\n446\\n00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:47,760\\nHowever, once we reach puberty, the thymus begins to shrink.\\n\\n447\\n00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:54,080\\nIt is replaced by fatty tissue and eventually stops producing new T cells.\\n\\n448\\n00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:05,760\\nOnce we've used them up, our bodies become more susceptible to pathogens and to age related diseases like cancer, stroke and dementia.\\n\\n449\\n00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:22,720\\nWhen I saw that you could use growth hormone to regrow the thymus and take immune system function that was down to about 20% of the young immune system function all the way back up to 100% of youthful function.\\n\\n450\\n00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,640\\nI just thought we have to do something about this.\\n\\n451\\n00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,200\\nBut nobody took any action.\\n\\n452\\n00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:32,440\\nSo I did an experiment on myself and I regrew my own thymus.\\n\\n453\\n00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:41,840\\nHe published a scientific paper that described one person and that was himself.\\n\\n454\\n00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,840\\nIn 2016, the trial was repeated.\\n\\n455\\n00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:51,360\\nThis time, a total of nine test subjects renewed their thymus.\\n\\n456\\n00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:57,200\\nThey suspected the treatment was having a positive effect on the whole body.\\n\\n457\\n00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:01,040\\nBut how could he prove it?\\n\\n458\\n00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:07,320\\nThis person came to me and said, And you help me to analyze a treatment.\\n\\n459\\n00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,600\\nAnd the minute he said the word thymus rejuvenation, I already said yes, you know.\\n\\n460\\n00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:18,520\\nSteve Horvath compared blood samples from the test subjects before and after treatment.\\n\\n461\\n00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:24,120\\nAnd he was just as amazed, if not more amazed as we were about the results.\\n\\n462\\n00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,840\\nIf they are confirmed, it will be a sensation.\\n\\n463\\n00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:32,960\\nThe original intention was get rid of the fat of the thymus.\\n\\n464\\n00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,480\\nThis treatment had a side effect and unexpected side effect.\\n\\n465\\n00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:42,640\\nIt really rejuvenated the methylation, the epigenetic clock and.\\n\\n466\\n00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:50,520\\nAll nine test subjects turn their epigenetic clocks back by around 18 months and a year of treatment.\\n\\n467\\n00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:59,240\\nThat means they had essentially reversed their biological age by two and a half years.\\n\\n468\\n00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:05,400\\nWe began to get reports from some of the people in the trial that I feel great.\\n\\n469\\n00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,600\\nYou know, I feel so energetic now.\\n\\n470\\n00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:12,040\\nI feel my mind is working faster than it's worked before.\\n\\n471\\n00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:20,400\\nBefore this trial was over, this volunteer says, you know, my my wife has been telling me that my hair's growing and dark again.\\n\\n472\\n00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,240\\nAnd I said, really?\\n\\n473\\n00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,280\\nThat's interesting. Let's have a look.\\n\\n474\\n00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:28,600\\nSo we looked at his hair and boy, it was a big, very strong difference.\\n\\n475\\n00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:33,440\\nHis hair was darkening all over the place.\\n\\n476\\n00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:42,720\\nI need to say we are all very excited about it, but we are also very sober scientists.\\n\\n477\\n00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:48,680\\nYou know, and therefore, we always felt we desperately need a second validation study.\\n\\n478\\n00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:55,120\\nAnd that's really why I continue to work with Greg, why I become a study participant.\\n\\n479\\n00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:01,000\\nA third study with more test subjects aims to corroborate the original results.\\n\\n480\\n00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:10,640\\nIf successful, the famous regeneration could be the first scientifically proven anti-aging treatment for human beings.\\n\\n481\\n00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,720\\nBut the scientists need more data.\\n\\n482\\n00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:19,640\\nSteve Horvath and his brother have volunteered to take part in the trial as identical twins.\\n\\n483\\n00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,320\\nThey are ideal candidates.\\n\\n484\\n00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:27,600\\nSteve will get the rejuvenation treatment and Marcus will join the control group.\\n\\n485\\n00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,840\\nWe're now ready for your baseline testing.\\n\\n486\\n00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:35,680\\nAnd this is the testing that you do before entering the term X trial.\\n\\n487\\n00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:40,680\\nAnd then we'll assess you after 12 months of treatment and see how you fare. At that point.\\n\\n488\\n00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:41,480\\nThe first step is.\\n\\n489\\n00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:49,440\\nA functional test where you're literally just standing up and sitting back down as many times as you can within 30 seconds.\\n\\n490\\n00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,640\\nThe outcome for me and.\\n\\n491\\n00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:57,360\\nThe entire alliance, ever since we know that, no, I had a better breakfast and.\\n\\n492\\n00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:02,520\\nMaybe after 12 months of the term treatment, you'll be able to compete with that. All right.\\n\\n493\\n00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:04,840\\nAnd I'll give you a countdown.\\n\\n494\\n00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,200\\nOkay.

\\n    66\\n    00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,640\\n    but never sort of to,\\n    \\n    67\\n    00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,800\\n    you know, look at the root cause of these diseases\\n    \\n    68\\n    00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000\\n    and take it from there.\\n    \\n    69\\n    00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,440\\n    Each animal species\\n    \\n    70\\n    00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,280\\n    has in certain ways an expiration date in a mouse.\\n    \\n    71\\n    00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,440\\n    It's less than five years in the bowhead whale.\\n    \\n    72\\n    00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,560\\n    It's 211 years in humans, it's 122.\\n    \\n    73\\n    00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,440\\n    Each species has a time that's kind of a allocated to it.\\n    \\n    74\\n    00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,000\\n    And the question is, why is that\\n    \\n    75\\n    00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,280\\n    in nature?\\n    \\n    76\\n    00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,520\\n    Death is a normal part of life, but can we\\n    \\n    77\\n    00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,360\\n    humans push this biological age limit?\\n    \\n    78\\n    00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,840\\n    Human life expectancy has risen steadily in recent history.\\n    \\n    79\\n    00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,880\\n    Back in ancient Rome, it was just 25 years.\\n    \\n    80\\n    00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,080\\n    By the Middle Ages, it was still only 35.\\n    \\n    81\\n    00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,440\\n    Now we live into our seventies.\\n    \\n    82\\n    00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,240\\n    On average, medical advances and better living conditions\\n    \\n    83\\n    00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,080\\n    are enabling us to get older and older.\\n    \\n    84\\n    00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,600\\n    But can we extend our lifespan indefinitely?\\n    \\n    85\\n    00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:37,480\\n    And would we really want to?\\n    \\n    86\\n    00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,680\\n    If you believe in evolution and.\\n    \\n    87\\n    00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,760\\n    Lots of people want to live forever\\n    \\n    88\\n    00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,640\\n    and they wonder if we can reverse or slow down the aging process in.\\n    \\n    89\\n    00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,800\\n    An unkind.\\n    \\n    90\\n    00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,680\\n    History tells us\\n    \\n    91\\n    00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,120\\n    so much about violence, death and dying,\\n    \\n    92\\n    00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,120\\n    but it also touches on reincarnation and life.\\n    \\n    93\\n    00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,960\\n    It's a hugely popular thing.\\n    \\n    94\\n    00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,360\\n    Immortality is a topic that will never die.\\n    \\n    95\\n    00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,600\\n    Is abolition\\n    \\n    96\\n    00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,000\\n    in Germany.\\n    \\n    97\\n    00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,560\\n    There's a famous painting, The Fountain of Youth.\\n    \\n    98\\n    00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,680\\n    And on the painting you see all the old men and women, particularly\\n    \\n    99\\n    00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,880\\n    taking their clothes off\\n    \\n    100\\n    00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,320\\n    and getting into the fountain of youth\\n    \\n    101\\n    00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,240\\n    and swimming across\\n    \\n    102\\n    00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,080\\n    to the other side and emerging young and healthy on the other side.\\n    \\n    103\\n    00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,800\\n    And then going off to the tents and dressing\\n    \\n    104\\n    00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,080\\n    and then having a wonderful dinner together with plenty of wine.\\n    \\n    105\\n    00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,800\\n    And it's it's man's age old dream\\n    \\n    106\\n    00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,360\\n    to be able to reverse aging.\\n    \\n    107\\n    00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:41,800\\n    He says\\n    \\n    108\\n    00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,440\\n    this fountain of youth has become an allegory in biomedical research.\\n    \\n    109\\n    00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,320\\n    It's no longer\\n    \\n    110\\n    00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,400\\n    just about eating a healthy diet and leading a balanced lifestyle.\\n    \\n    111\\n    00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,360\\n    We want to make more serious adjustments and we can take pills\\n    \\n    112\\n    00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,680\\n    or get injections and so on, and we'll end up living longer.\\n    \\n    113\\n    00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,200\\n    The idea of the fountain of youth that's outside me\\n    \\n    114\\n    00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,680\\n    that I can jump into is shifted to a fountain that's put inside me,\\n    \\n    115\\n    00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,240\\n    injected into me.\\n    \\n    116\\n    00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,800\\n    And it's an opposite.\\n    \\n    117\\n    00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,080\\n    We are closer to finding the fountain of youth than ever before.\\n    \\n    118\\n    00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,200\\n    But what if aging were kind of program?\\n    \\n    119\\n    00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,280\\n    A program we could hack into\\n    \\n    120\\n    00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,320\\n    an initial clue\\n    \\n    121\\n    00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,160\\n    as to how humans might be reprogramed.\\n    \\n    122\\n    00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,680\\n    Leads to an unassuming setting in Central America.\\n    \\n    123\\n    00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,400\\n    And\\n    \\n    124\\n    00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,600\\n    I've lived in Costa Rica since 1972\\n    \\n    125\\n    00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,240\\n    and just completely fell in love\\n    \\n    126\\n    00:07:52,240 -->

people age\\n    \\n    129\\n    00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,560\\n    very well and long.\\n    \\n    130\\n    00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,600\\n    I think about it all the time.\\n    \\n    131\\n    00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,360\\n    I think about it all the time because it's really mysterious and\\n    \\n    132\\n    00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,280\\n    they themselves can not give you any clues as to why you ask them.\\n    \\n    133\\n    00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,680\\n    And they say, I have no idea.\\n    \\n    134\\n    00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,000\\n    It just is what it is.\\n    \\n    135\\n    00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,120\\n    But yet we are more curious and we want to know more.\\n    \\n    136\\n    00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,480\\n    Ana Gayle Glen\\n    \\n

me.\\n    \\n    237\\n    00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,480\\n    But how exactly and will this help us\\n    \\n    238\\n    00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:55,320\\n    crack the aging code?\\n    \\n    239\\n    00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,480\\n    I'm molecular biologist, biochemist.\\n    \\n    240\\n    00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,760\\n    I'm interested in understanding the origin of diseases.\\n    \\n    241\\n    00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,480\\n    The majority of diseases are those associated with the aging process.\\n    \\n    242\\n    00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,920\\n    So I'm interested in understanding why we age the molecular level.\\n    \\n    243\\n    00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,440\\n    I wanted to devote my life\\n    \\n    244\\n    00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,880\\n    to understand the origins of cancer on aging.\\n    \\n    245\\n    00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,880\\n    I thought telomerase could be the key.\\n    \\n    246\\n    00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,320\\n    The human body consists of around 37 trillion\\n    \\n    247\\n    00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,280\\n    cells, some last a few days.\\n    \\n    248\\n    00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,240\\n    Others live for years.\\n    \\n    249\\n    00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,920\\n    We constantly produce new cells to replace the old ones.\\n    \\n    250\\n    00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:40,320\\n    It's a process that involves duplication.\\n    \\n    251\\n    00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,640\\n    Before cell division can take place, the chromosomes\\n    \\n    252\\n    00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,280\\n    in the cell nucleus have to be duplicated.\\n    \\n    253\\n    00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,320\\n    The DNA double helix\\n    \\n    254\\n    00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,760\\n    they consist of is unwound and separated into strands.\\n    \\n    255\\n    00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,760\\n    Each strand then becomes a template for a new one.\\n    \\n    256\\n    00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,800\\n    The ends of the chromosomes,\\n    \\n    257\\n    00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,520\\n    which are especially prone to replication errors,\\n    \\n    258\\n    00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:07,760\\n    are protected by telomeres, which are sequences of non-coding DNA.\\n    \\n    259\\n    00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,080\\n    But with every cell division, these safety caps\\n    \\n    260\\n    00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,080\\n    become shorter\\n    \\n    261\\n    00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,200\\n    and.\\n    \\n    262\\n    00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:22,960\\n    Less\\n    \\n    263\\n    00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,080\\n    charged.\\n    \\n    264\\n    00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,880\\n    I feel charged\\n    \\n    265\\n    00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,800\\n    with that.\\n    \\n    266\\n    00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,280\\n    The issue\\n    \\n    267\\n    00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:45,040\\n    of the telomeres.\\n    \\n    268\\n    00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,280\\n    Imagine this shoelace is our chromosome.\\n    \\n    269\\n    00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,920\\n    So this part of the shoelace is the DNA\\n    \\n    270\\n    00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,280\\n    where the genetic information is.\\n    \\n    271\\n    00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,280\\n    And this little plastic part,\\n    \\n    272\\n    00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,560\\n    which is very important to protect the shoelace would be the telomere.\\n    \\n    273\\n    00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,640\\n    So the telomeres are very important to protect our chromosomes,\\n    \\n    274\\n    00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,920\\n    to protect the DNA.\\n    \\n    275\\n    00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,440\\n    As we age, the telomeres become shorter and shorter.\\n    \\n    276\\n    00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,880\\n    This is because every time that we have a damage,\\n    \\n    277\\n    00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,320\\n    the cells have to multiply to regenerate the damage.\\n    \\n    278\\n    00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,880\\n    And this shortens the delivers\\n    \\n    279\\n    00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,000\\n    to the cell division of the cell multiplication.\\n    \\n    280\\n    00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,560\\n    So at the end,\\n    \\n    281\\n    00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,840\\n    the telomeres become so short that we don't have any more active them.\\n    \\n    282\\n    00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,800\\n    So now our DNA is unprotected and this is leading to\\n    \\n    283\\n    00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,880\\n    aging, is leading to disease, and ultimately will be leading to this\\n    \\n    284\\n    00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,480\\n    cell division.\\n    \\n    285\\n    00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,160\\n    And the rate of telomere shortening may be influenced by our lifestyle,\\n    \\n    286\\n    00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,000\\n    smoking, stress, environmental pollutants\\n    \\n    287\\n    00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,320\\n    and poor nutrition are all negative factors.\\n    \\n    288\\n    00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,080\\n    Some researchers believe living in harmony with the natural world\\n    \\n    289\\n    00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:54,120\\n    has a positive effect.\\n    \\n    290\\n    00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,760\\n    You know, Sartre's sucking.\\n    \\n    291\\n    00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,480\\n    We couldn't carry out experiments like this in Costa Rica,\\n    \\n    292\\n    00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,520\\n    so we sent our samples away.\\n    \\n    293\\n    00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,680\\n    When the results of this collaboration came back,\\n    \\n    294\\n    00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,160\\n    we realized we'd found something.\\n    \\n    295\\n    00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,440\\n    Lost in a similar anarchy.\\n    \\n    296\\n    00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:07,840\\n    Okay.\\n    \\n    297\\n    00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,040\\n    And then contra las personas. Nicole.\\n    \\n    298\\n    00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,800\\n    Kaya, DNA.\\n    \\n    299\\n    00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,280\\n    People from Nicoya have longer telomeres,\\n    \\n    300\\n    00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,360\\n    significantly longer telomeres than people in the rest of the country.\\n    \\n    301\\n    00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,400\\n    This tiny piece.\\n    \\n    302\\n    00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,200\\n    Scientists like Maria Blasco\\n    \\n    303\\n    00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,880\\n    are exploring ways of artificially lengthening telomeres\\n    \\n    304\\n    00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,280\\n    in order to slow the aging process.\\n    \\n    305\\n    00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,440\\n    But this does come at a risk.\\n    \\n    306\\n    00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,120\\n    To your father by is does.\\n    \\n    307\\n    00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,960\\n    The danger is that cancer can develop because cancer\\n    \\n    308\\n    00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,720\\n    cells are immortal and we're walking a fine line here.\\n    \\n    309\\n    00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,720\\n    Do we tell the cells to resist their preprogramed cell death and risk\\n    \\n    310\\n    00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,520\\n    that it will result in cancer?\\n    \\n    311\\n    00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,840\\n    Or do we leave things to run their natural course\\n    \\n    312\\n    00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,040\\n    and let the cells die when their time is up\\n    \\n    313\\n    00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,800\\n    and there's no proliferation?\\n    \\n    314\\n    00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,720\\n    And we just accept\\n    \\n    315\\n    00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:00,360\\n    that our final destination is around 120 to 125 years.\\n    \\n    316\\n    00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,400\\n    Of unsuccessful, not from one scientist.\\n    \\n    317\\n    00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,560\\n    But of course we all know the answer.\\n    \\n    318\\n    00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,880\\n    Humans want to test the boundaries\\n    \\n    319\\n    00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,840\\n    and see if they can really live to 150\\n    \\n    320\\n    00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,000\\n    or 300 and.\\n    \\n    321\\n    00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,640\\n    How far can we go?\\n    \\n    322\\n    00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,120\\n    How much should science interfere\\n    \\n    323\\n    00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:30,280\\n    in nature's blueprint?\\n    \\n    324\\n    00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,560\\n    We don't have to necessarily accept current\\n    \\n    325\\n    00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,720\\n    biological limitations because that's what we do as a species.\\n    \\n    326\\n    00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,400\\n    We're problem solvers.\\n    \\n    327\\n    00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,120\\n    We don't just sit around and get rained on, we build houses.\\n    \\n    328\\n    00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:46,560\\n    So we may want to transcend normal biology at some point\\n    \\n    329\\n    00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,440\\n    and set goals for ourself beyond just normal concepts\\n    \\n    330\\n    00:18:50,440 --> 00:19:03,960\\n    of health.\\n    \\n    331\\n    00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,320\\n    When you wonder about what is aging, you end up asking\\n    \\n    332\\n    00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,440\\n    how tissues repair.\\n    \\n    333\\n    00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:16,400\\n    This is a process that is still poorly understood.\\n    \\n    334\\n    00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,600\\n    Cells progressively accumulate damage they age,\\n    \\n    335\\n    00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:28,080\\n    but when they reach a certain threshold, they undergo a switch.\\n    \\n    336\\n    00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,680\\n    They become senescent.\\n    \\n    337\\n    00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:31,840\\n    I like to describe\\n    \\n    338\\n    00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,040\\n    them as zombies because, you know,\\n    \\n    339\\n    00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,600\\n    they're like in a middle stage between alive and dead.\\n    \\n    340\\n    00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,200\\n    They're not either, but they're at the same time\\n    \\n    341\\n    00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,080\\n    they're really damaging.\\n    \\n    342\\n    00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,560\\n    Senescent\\n    \\n    343\\n    00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,240\\n    cells produce an alarm signal\\n    \\n    344\\n    00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,280\\n    so that the other cells in the body\\n    \\n    345\\n    00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,320\\n    realize that there is a damage there and they go and they repair.\\n    \\n    346\\n    00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,440\\n    The problem is that as we get older, these\\n    \\n    347\\n    00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,160\\n    repair says they are also old and they don't go and they don't repair.\\n    \\n    348\\n    00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,960\\n    And we accumulate these cells that are constantly producing this alarm.\\n    \\n    349\\n    00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,440\\n    This is a phenomenon that is called inflammation.\\n    \\n    350\\n    00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,600\\n    All people have inflammatory signals\\n    \\n    351\\n    00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:16,040\\n    elevated caused by their own senescent cells\\n    \\n    352\\n    00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:22,440\\n    that are not eliminated.\\n    \\n    353\\n    00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,000\\n    We are trying to crack the code of these senescent\\n    \\n    354\\n    00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,240\\n    cells, trying to understand their vulnerabilities, how to kill them\\n    \\n    355\\n    00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,800\\n    without killing the non senescent cells.\\n    \\n    356\\n    00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,040\\n    In some initial experiments, Manuel Serrano\\n    \\n    357\\n    00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,720\\n    and his team were able to show that mice lived longer.\\n    \\n    358\\n    00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,960\\n    Once they're senescent or zombie cells were eliminated.\\n    \\n    359\\n    00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,600\\n    But that does not guarantee eternal youth.\\n    \\n    360\\n    00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,600\\n    It's a double edged sword.\\n    \\n    361\\n    00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,520\\n    Senescent cells play also very good,\\n    \\n    362\\n    00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,280\\n    an important role, for example, in wound healing.\\n    \\n    363\\n    00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,720\\n    If you have a wound,\\n    \\n    364\\n    00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,240\\n    if you don't have senescence, the wound will never hear.\\n    \\n    365\\n    00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,720\\n    So you could have a treatment that removes all senescent cells\\n    \\n    366\\n    00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,160\\n    and suddenly you have terrible side effects.\\n    \\n    367\\n    00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,280\\n    It just means we need more research, you know.\\n    \\n    368\\n    00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,680\\n    Research into telomeres and zombie cells are only\\n    \\n    369\\n    00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,240\\n    two approaches in the race for longevity.\\n    \\n    370\\n    00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,080\\n    And one thing is certain whoever cracks the code\\n    \\n    371\\n    00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:33,440\\n    is set to earn millions.\\n    \\n    372\\n    00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,760\\n    All right,\\n    \\n    373\\n    00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,760\\n    so, guys, how do I look?\\n    \\n    374\\n    00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:45,440\\n    Do I look old?\\n    \\n    375\\n    00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,680\\n    So you've seen what we did.\\n    \\n    376\\n    00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,760\\n    We've announced that $255 million raise\\n    \\n    377\\n    00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,360\\n    is the largest raise in our industry\\n    \\n    378\\n    00:21:54,360 --> 00:22:04,680\\n    to date.\\n    \\n    379\\n    00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:08,280\\n    Hong Kong has the highest life expectancy on the planet today,\\n    \\n    380\\n    00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,760\\n    which is no surprise because longevity is very often\\n    \\n    381\\n    00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,960\\n    correlate it with wealth.\\n    \\n    382\\n    00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,320\\n    And here people are filthy rich.\\n    \\n    383\\n    00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,960\\n    Welfare is\\n    \\n    384\\n    00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,520\\n    increasing dramatically in the region, in China, in mainland\\n    \\n    385\\n    00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,680\\n    people who were peasants just 35 years ago,\\n    \\n    386\\n    00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,760\\n    they are now multimillionaires.\\n    \\n    387\\n    00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:39,480\\n    And people demand longevity.\\n    \\n    388\\n    00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,360\\n    As a CEO of a biotech company,\\n    \\n    389\\n    00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,040\\n    I tried to collaborate with a lot of people and I tried to contribute\\n    \\n    390\\n    00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:52,040\\n    as many projects as possible.\\n    \\n    391\\n    00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:56,840\\n    Life Clinic is a very fun concept where the founder is decided\\n    \\n    392\\n    00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,880\\n    to bridge the Starbucks concept\\n    \\n    393\\n    00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,280\\n    with preventative medical care.\\n    \\n    394\\n    00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,000\\n    You choose a cocktail of all kinds of nutrients\\n    \\n    395\\n    00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,200\\n    that will be going into your blood\\n    \\n    396\\n    00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,240\\n    while you are sipping on a juice.\\n    \\n    397\\n

Be. Correct.\\n    \\n    400\\n    00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,360\\n    Correct.\\n    \\n    401\\n    00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,720\\n    In Hong Kong?

   454\\n    00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:27,080\\n    I was interested in anti-aging signs since I was a teenager\\n    \\n    455\\n    00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,560\\n    growing up in Frankfurt, Germany.\\n    \\n    456\\n    00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:35,000\\n    I had a group of friends who were very interested in science,\\n    \\n    457\\n    00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,000\\n    and at some point we realized the most important\\n    \\n    458\\n    00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000\\n    challenge of our generation is to prolong life.\\n    \\n    459\\n    00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,480\\n    We had very lofty goals.\\n    \\n    460\\n    00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,360\\n    I need to tell you, you know, we have crazy goals.\\n    \\n    461\\n    00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:53,640\\n    We wanted to study physics, math, biology, chemistry.\\n    \\n    462\\n    00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,920\\n    Also, we wanted to do space travel.\\n    \\n    463\\n    00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,520\\n    And then\\n    \\n    464\\n    00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,200\\n    the minute you think of space travel, you realize that you will need\\n    \\n    465\\n    00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,360\\n    decades, you know, to travel for centuries.\\n    \\n    466\\n    00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,520\\n    And so we felt we really need to solve this problem first\\n    \\n    467\\n    00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:15,080\\n    to extend our lifespan before we can even think about space travel\\n    \\n    468\\n    00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,200\\n    one day by accident.\\n    \\n    469\\n    00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,040\\n    Really, because I did somebody a favor.\\n    \\n    470\\n    00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,160\\n    I analyze this methylation data.\\n    \\n    471\\n    00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,360\\n    I immediately recognized that epigenetics\\n    \\n    472\\n    00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,120\\n    or methylation is really the data source\\n    \\n    473\\n    00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,800\\n    that has a tremendous signal for aging.\\n    \\n    474\\n    00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,560\\n    He was able to find clusters of genes\\n    \\n    475\\n    00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,040\\n    whose methylation state could tell you\\n    \\n    476\\n    00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,240\\n    how old you were at a particular time.\\n    \\n    477\\n    00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,240\\n    The amazing thing about this is that it works\\n    \\n    478\\n    00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,840\\n    from the day you're created as a fertilized egg cell\\n    \\n    479\\n    00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:56,080\\n    all the way until the day that you die.\\n    \\n    480\\n    00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,160\\n    There are more than 200 distinct cell types in the human body,\\n    \\n    481\\n    00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,480\\n    although they all contain the same DNA.\\n    \\n    482\\n    00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,800\\n    There is a mechanism\\n    \\n    483\\n    00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,760\\n    that tells the cell whether it is a skin cell or a liver cell.\\n    \\n    484\\n    00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:14,320\\n    For example, called epigenetics.\\n    \\n    485\\n    00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,920\\n    This involves information that sits on the DNA\\n    \\n    486\\n    00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:25,040\\n    resulting in genes being switched on or off.\\n    \\n    487\\n    00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:29,200\\n    Perhaps the best known type of epigenetic change is methylation,\\n    \\n    488\\n    00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,320\\n    the addition or removal of methyl groups\\n    \\n    489\\n    00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,640\\n    on the DNA strand.\\n    \\n    490\\n    00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:41,600\\n    These changes continue to take place throughout our lives.\\n    \\n    491\\n    00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,600\\n    The DNA contains four letters.\\n    \\n    492\\n    00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:48,720\\n    A CTG methylation sometimes attaches to the letter\\n    \\n    493\\n    00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,520\\n    C and modifies it similar to an omelet\\n    \\n    494\\n    00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,200\\n    by keeping track very carefully\\n    \\n    495\\n    00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,840\\n    which parts of the DNA gain, methylation\\n    \\n    496\\n    00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,720\\n    or lose methylation we can measure aging\\n    \\n    497\\n    00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:07,560\\n    methylation can be sort of like the rust that accumulates.\\n    \\n    498\\n    00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,040\\n    By measuring the amount of rust, we can determine age.\\n    \\n    499\\n    00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,800\\n    So if we have an hourglass, the passage of time is measured\\n    \\n    500\\n    00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:21,280\\n    by how the sand how much sand accumulates at the bottom.\\n    \\n    501\\n    00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:25,040\\n    The DNA molecule, though, has 28 million\\n    \\n    502\\n    00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,880\\n    different hourglass because we have 28 million.\\n    \\n    503\\n    00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,440\\n    Let us see in our DNA.\\n    \\n    504\\n    00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,280\\n    So by averaging the measurements of 28 million hour\\n    \\n    505\\n    00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:42,160\\n    glasses, you arrive at a very accurate measure of age.\\n    \\n    506\\n    00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,720\\n    This is one of the most\\n    \\n    507\\n    00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:47,320\\n    insightful discoveries in the history of mankind.\\n    \\n    508\\n    00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,200\\n    Does we like the invention of the wheel?\\n    \\n    509\\n    00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,040\\n    What is.\\n    \\n    510\\n    00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,200\\n    That? Definitely as a turning point in aging?\\n    \\n    511\\n    00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,760\\n    I think that was just a very,\\n    \\n    512\\n    00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:59,000\\n    very important point where we realized, hey, we can measure aging now.\\n    \\n    513\\n    00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,280\\n    The epigenetic clock has revolutionized research into aging\\n    \\n    514\\n    00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,680\\n    with a simple DNA sample.\\n    \\n    515\\n    00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,920\\n    Anyone's biologic age can be determined,\\n    \\n    516\\n    00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,080\\n    however, that can produce\\n    \\n    517\\n    00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:20,920\\n    some nasty surprises.\\n    \\n    518\\n    00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,960\\n    My name is Marcus Horvath, and I am Steve's\\n    \\n    519\\n    00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,520\\n    identical twin brother\\n    \\n    520\\n    00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,040\\n    is my older twin.\\n    \\n    521\\n    00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,320\\n    Brother is 5 minutes older than me,\\n    \\n    522\\n    00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,880\\n    however, only at birth.\\n    \\n    523\\n    00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,880\\n    We measured our epigenetic clock a couple of years ago,\\n    \\n    524\\n    00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,440\\n    and then according to one of the clocks,\\n    \\n    525\\n    00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,520\\n    I was actually four years older than him,\\n    \\n    526\\n    00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:56,800\\n    which is not necessarily good news.\\n    \\n    527\\n    00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:01,840\\n    Those technologies are enabling us to accelerate\\n    \\n    528\\n    00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,360\\n    aging research dramatically by not waiting until you die.\\n    \\n    529\\n    00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,400\\n    We can now measure where you.\\n    \\n    530\\n    00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,880\\n    Are in life.\\n    \\n    531\\n    00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,240\\n    And measure how different interventions affect\\n    \\n    532\\n    00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,680\\n    that prediction.\\n    \\n    533\\n    00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:20,560\\n    We picked this up and applied a to the same problem\\n    \\n    534\\n    00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,920\\n    and developed many, many Asian clocks.\\n    \\n    535\\n    00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,240\\n    Above all, the quest\\n    \\n    536\\n    00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,800\\n    for eternal life requires personal biological data.\\n    \\n    537\\n    00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,600\\n    The digital devices we use every day can provide mountains of it.\\n    \\n    538\\n    00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,800\\n    Big data is currently one of the most promising\\n    \\n    539\\n    00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,240\\n    approaches to cracking the aging code.\\n    \\n    540\\n    00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,960\\n    Unlike conventional medicine\\n    \\n    541\\n    00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,720\\n    or artificial intelligence can scour the data for hidden patterns\\n    \\n    542\\n    00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,480\\n    to help prevent diseases from developing in the first place.\\n    \\n    543\\n    00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,040\\n    This situation looks very\\n    \\n    544\\n    00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,480\\n    similar to fast on the subway.\\n    \\n    545\\n    00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,800\\n    So when you pull your wallet and you don't know who,\\n    \\n    546\\n    00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:03,080\\n    every human on the train looks the same.\\n    \\n    547\\n    00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:03,840\\n    They move.\\n    \\n    548\\n    00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:11,280\\n    They move in different patterns.\\n    \\n    549\\n    00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:15,440\\n    So you need to observe many, many of those scenarios\\n    \\n    550\\n    00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:19,520\\n    in many subways globally to develop\\n    \\n    551\\n    00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:23,240\\n    a really precise algorithm for catching a thief on the subway.\\n    \\n    552\\n    00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,800\\n    And you train AI technologies to recognize those thieves\\n    \\n    553\\n    00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,120\\n    and predict human behavior.\\n    \\n    554\\n    00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:35,320\\n    And I think nowadays in advanced countries like mainland China,\\n    \\n    555\\n    00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,200\\n    there are video monitoring techniques that allow you automatically\\n    \\n    556\\n    00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,880\\n    to recognize the fast\\n    \\n    557\\n    00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,160\\n    movement.\\n    \\n    558\\n    00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,360\\n    So it's very similar to recognize\\n    \\n    559\\n    00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,680\\n    those proteins that misbehave during aging\\n    \\n    560\\n    00:32:50,840 --> 00:33:01,320\\n    and cause trouble.\\n    \\n    561\\n    00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:01,560\\n    Yeah.\\n    \\n    562\\n    00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:05,480\\n    So what we are going to do now, we're going to solve a disease\\n    \\n    563\\n    00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,600\\n    very quickly.\\n    \\n    564\\n    00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,120\\n    We're going to solve the Crohn's disease.\\n    \\n    565\\n    00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,840\\n    A.I.\\n    \\n    566\\n    00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,200\\n    is already poised to increase our life expectancy,\\n    \\n    567\\n    00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,120\\n    or so\\n    \\n    568\\n    00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:21,800\\n    we're told, at the touch of a button.\\n    \\n    569\\n    00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,600\\n    Start ups can run through thousands of possible outcomes and quickly\\n    \\n    570\\n    00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:32,040\\n    discover new medications,\\n    \\n    571\\n    00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:36,160\\n    all based on data from users of apps like the one that Alex\\n    \\n    572\\n    00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:40,400\\n    Zhavoronkov has developed.\\n    \\n    573\\n    00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:44,000\\n    We recently received $255 million\\n    \\n    574\\n    00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,040\\n    from a group of ultra elite investors.\\n    \\n    575\\n    00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,200\\n    So it turned out that we are in the right place,\\n    \\n    576\\n    00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,040\\n    in the right time, with the right technology.\\n    \\n    577\\n    00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:57,080\\n    I think that very soon we will see guys like Amazon.\\n    \\n    578\\n    00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:01,560\\n    I'm waiting for those guys to react, guys like Facebook,\\n    \\n    579\\n    00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,960\\n    guys that produce video games, Netflix,\\n    \\n    580\\n    00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,560\\n    those people who steal your time,\\n    \\n    581\\n    00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,040\\n    they will come back and try to figure out how to make more time\\n    \\n    582\\n    00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:21,000\\n    so you can wasted on their product.\\n    \\n    583\\n    00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,640\\n    Silicon Valley is already on board.\\n    \\n    584\\n    00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:29,400\\n    In 2013, Google founded a secretive biotech venture called Calico.\\n    \\n    585\\n    00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,680\\n    Its longevity research is carried out behind\\n    \\n    586\\n    00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,960\\n    closed doors with nearly unlimited resources.\\n    \\n    587\\n    00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,080\\n    A group backed by Amazon founder Jeff\\n    \\n    588\\n    00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:42,600\\n    Bezos has also burst onto the anti-aging scene\\n    \\n    589\\n    00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:46,680\\n    with hundreds of millions in funding Altos Labs\\n    \\n    590\\n    00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:50,840\\n    is recruiting top scientists from around the globe to join the project.\\n    \\n    591\\n    00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,360\\n    They include Steve Horvath and Manuel Serrano.\\n    \\n    592\\n    00:34:54,920 --> 00:35:02,920\\n    There's even a longevity clinic in the pipeline.\\n    \\n    593\\n    00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,960\\n    Despite the big players jockeying for position,\\n    \\n    594\\n    00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,960\\n    there are still opportunities for smaller projects\\n    \\n    595\\n    00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,480\\n    like Startup Bio Biotin,\\n    \\n    596\\n    00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,400\\n    which is working flat out to develop a self-test\\n    \\n    597\\n    00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,360\\n    to measure aging.\\n    \\n    598\\n    00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,440\\n    Biotin is a group of people who are working towards the goal\\n    \\n    599\\n    00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:27,760\\n    of extending healthspan and eradicating aging with its users.\\n    \\n    600\\n    00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,960\\n    We're all just sort of a group of people with a sort of a fascination\\n    \\n    601\\n    00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,760\\n    for age related diseases and aging itself.\\n    \\n    602\\n    00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:37,800\\n    We have sort of focused on this idea of biological age itself.\\n    \\n    603\\n    00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,400\\n    We tell you what your biological age is in sort of an accessible\\n    \\n    604\\n    00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,120\\n    and cheap manner.\\n    \\n    605\\n    00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:43,800\\n    And a lot\\n    \\n    606\\n    00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,800\\n    of biological age tests currently are very pricey, which is fine.\\n    \\n    607\\n    00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,960\\n    I mean, it makes total sense,\\n    \\n    608\\n    00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,360\\n    especially for Biohackers\\n    \\n    609\\n    00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,840\\n    and people who are way more interested in the very deep signs of aging.\\n    \\n    610\\n    00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,800\\n    But we just want to give\\n    \\n    611\\n    00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,360\\n    and general encapsulation of your aging process\\n    \\n    612\\n    00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,440\\n    to the general population.\\n    \\n    613\\n    00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,800\\n    Nina's clock is designed to determine\\n    \\n    614\\n    00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,320\\n    age based on proteins in saliva,\\n    \\n    615\\n    00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,520\\n    although she can only work in a lab once she turns 16,\\n    \\n    616\\n    00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,640\\n    she's found ways to access the latest data.\\n    \\n    617\\n    00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,640\\n    Go to research paper website\\n    \\n    618\\n    00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,600\\n    and they are supplementary files\\n    \\n    619\\n    00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,640\\n    that we were able to download and see their data.\\n    \\n    620\\n    00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,600\\n    So that's really cool.\\n    \\n    621\\n    00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,120\\n    Sometimes when it comes to us working directly with labs,\\n    \\n    622\\n    00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,800\\n    they send us the data personally.\\n    \\n    623\\n    00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,680\\n    They tell us Here is the work we've done because it often helps them to\\n    \\n    624\\n    00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:32,280\\n    in their projects.\\n    \\n    625\\n    00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,640\\n    You know, people like Nina\\n    \\n    626\\n    00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:37,160\\n    are taking advantage of a new paradigm, really,\\n    \\n    627\\n    00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,320\\n    in which you can the data on your own data is available.\\n    \\n    628\\n    00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,840\\n    My lab does that.\\n    \\n    629\\n    00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:46,320\\n    On the one hand, I download data, but I also upload a lot of data.\\n    \\n    630\\n    00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,160\\n    I put millions of dollars worth of data into the public domain.\\n    \\n    631\\n    00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,600\\n    I think it's cool. Yeah,\\n    \\n    632\\n    00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,400\\n    I think it's very cool.\\n    \\n    633\\n    00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,760\\n    Actually.\\n    \\n    634\\n    00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,040\\n    I know you're making some progress on the image of the test recently\\n    \\n    635\\n    00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,600\\n    and kind of have a good rendering.\\n    \\n    636\\n    00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,040\\n    And did you want to show your screen\\n    \\n    637\\n    00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,520\\n    and show what that might look like?\\n    \\n    638\\n    00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,360\\n    Yeah, I'll just do that right now.\\n    \\n    639\\n    00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,240\\n    Hold on.\\n    \\n    640\\n    00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,640\\n    Basically right now,\\n    \\n    641\\n    00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,920\\n    I think what we decided was\\n    \\n    642\\n    00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,600\\n    the best way is like having a multi panel test\\n    \\n    643\\n    00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,000\\n    with each corresponding to one protein.\\n    \\n    644\\n    00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,240\\n    We're using the same technology used in pregnancy tests.\\n    \\n    645\\n    00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,400\\n    So I think that's pretty interesting.\\n    \\n    646\\n    00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,800\\n    He's spent on the test in the sample area.\\n    \\n    647\\n    00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,360\\n    Then from there,\\n    \\n    648\\n    00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:26,720\\n    you downloaded sort of our app and from there you're able to find out,\\n    \\n    649\\n    00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:31,560\\n    you know, the ratios of your control to sort of your protein line.\\n    \\n    650\\n    00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,840\\n    So what is the\\n    \\n    651\\n    00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:36,600\\n    concentration of these proteins and based on the color of this test,\\n    \\n    652\\n    00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,440\\n    so you you scan this, you find out that information\\n    \\n    653\\n    00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,440\\n    you entered into our website and you can find out more\\n    \\n    654\\n    00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,360\\n    about your aging process.\\n    \\n    655\\n    00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,120\\n    We want to do a subscription based\\n    \\n    656\\n    00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,000\\n    you know, you're going to get several tests a year\\n    \\n    657\\n    00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,640\\n    because, you know,\\n    \\n    658\\n    00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,520\\n    it's slowly going to get better, as, you know, as you improve too.\\n    \\n    659\\n    00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:56,760\\n    So it'll be really cool.\\n    \\n    660\\n    00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:00,440\\n    It would be very hard to conceive even\\n    \\n    661\\n    00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,280\\n    wanting to do that for me,\\n    \\n    662\\n    00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,920\\n    and I don't think anybody here is going to sign up\\n    \\n    663\\n    00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,040\\n    for it.\\n    \\n    664\\n    00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,000\\n    In contrast to Nina,\\n    \\n    665\\n    00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,560\\n    Ana, Gail Glen in Costa Rica has already ended her professional life.\\n    \\n    666\\n    00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:25,320\\n    A successful swimwear designer, she was able to retire at age 50.\\n    \\n    667\\n    00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,760\\n    Ever since, she's been involved in a range\\n    \\n    668\\n    00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,880\\n    of social projects.\\n    \\n    669\\n    00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,320\\n    It's about being unified.\\n    \\n    670\\n    00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,200\\n    It's about to participate and be of service.\\n    \\n    671\\n    00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,040\\n    You know, do what you can care for yourself,\\n    \\n    672\\n    00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,160\\n    but do what you can to care for others as well.\\n    \\n    673\\n    00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:47,240\\n    And hopefully you get to a point in life where your basic needs\\n    \\n    674\\n    00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,440\\n    are being met well enough\\n    \\n    675\\n    00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,320\\n    that you have plenty of time to care for others.\\n    \\n    676\\n    00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,400\\n    It boils down to the question,\\n    \\n    677\\n    00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,960\\n    you know, do I do I save myself or do I save my community?\\n    \\n    678\\n    00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,960\\n    And really, if your community doesn't survive, what kind of life\\n    \\n    679\\n    00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,520\\n    are you going to have?\\n    \\n    680\\n    00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,840\\n    A couple of years ago, a law was passed\\n    \\n    681\\n    00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,360\\n    to protect the longhairs\\n    \\n    682\\n    00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,800\\n    or the centenarians of the area that we live in, which is considered\\n    \\n    683\\n    00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:18,440\\n    a legal blue zone, legal, you know, by law in Costa Rica.\\n    \\n    684\\n    00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:24,640\\n    So that's new.\\n    \\n    685\\n    00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,800\\n    Nicoya is preparing for an increasing number of centenarians.\\n    \\n    686\\n    00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,880\\n    A private initiative aims raise\\n    \\n    687\\n    00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,640\\n    funds to build the region's first nursing home.\\n    \\n    688\\n    00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,120\\n    Rapid advances in longevity research\\n    \\n    689\\n    00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,640\\n    are prompting a rethink of existing social structures.\\n    \\n    690\\n    00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,560\\n    What will our lives look like if we continue\\n    \\n    691\\n    00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:55,040\\n    to grow older and older?\\n    \\n    692\\n    00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,840\\n    The centenarians did their contribution.\\n    \\n    693\\n    00:39:58,880 -->

heralds you ask them, How do you feel about this\\n    \\n    698\\n    00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,840\\n    project we're doing?\\n    \\n    699\\n    00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,640\\n    Well are completely.\\n    \\n    700\\n    00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,440\\n    I'm going to be 103 years go by.\\n    \\n    701\\n    00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,680\\n    That's great.\\n    \\n    702\\n    00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,640\\n    But when you get old, you eventually need some help.\\n    \\n    703\\n    00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:24,920\\n    You start.\\n    \\n    704\\n    00:40:24,920 -->

reached a point of evolution\\n    \\n    732\\n    00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,160\\n    where we need to accelerate evolution ourself.\\n    \\n    733\\n    00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:51,240\\n    To do this, we need to evolve and we need to change as humans as well.\\n    \\n    734\\n    00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,720\\n    The the lack of any other\\n    \\n    735\\n    00:41:56,840 -->

right?\\n    \\n    738\\n    00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,400\\n    But it works.\\n    \\n    739\\n    00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,560\\n    Nature's built up\\n    \\n    740\\n    00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:10,200\\n    life on this planet over the last four and a half billion years.\\n    \\n    741\\n    00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:14,480\\n    And it is fine tuned and honed and optimized\\n    \\n    742\\n    00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:18,000\\n    thanks to an unbelievable able degree of perfection.\\n    \\n    743\\n    00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,000\\n    So you have to be a little bit careful about messing with Mother\\n    \\n    744\\n    00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:31,800\\n    Nature.\\n    \\n    745\\n    00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,280\\n    But.\\n    \\n    746\\n    00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,560\\n    One of the interesting things about super centenarians and centenarians\\n    \\n    747\\n    00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:44,400\\n    is that their immune systems last much better than the rest of us,\\n    \\n    748\\n    00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,680\\n    which is clue as to the fact that you need to have a good immune system\\n    \\n    749\\n    00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:52,320\\n    in order to stay alive a long time.\\n    \\n    750\\n    00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,480\\n    Steve Horvath is one of the scientists\\n    \\n    751\\n    00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:04,360\\n    set to follow the call of Amazon boss Jeff Bezos.\\n    \\n    752\\n    00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:08,200\\n    But before he embarks on that new task, he's\\n    \\n    753\\n    00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,640\\n    focusing on another promising project.\\n    \\n    754\\n    00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:15,680\\n    It's the so-called trim trial designed by his colleague\\n    \\n    755\\n    00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:19,200\\n    Greg Fahy to reverse immune system aging.\\n    \\n    756\\n    00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,280\\n    Hardly any other study in the field\\n    \\n    757\\n    00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,320\\n    has prompted as much interest in recent times.\\n    \\n    758\\n    00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,120\\n    The flow of immune cells plays a central role\\n    \\n    759\\n    00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,400\\n    in fighting illness in our bodies.\\n    \\n    760\\n    00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:36,440\\n    But there's a limited supply of these essential cells.\\n    \\n    761\\n    00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:40,000\\n    Our bodies, thymus gland, produces t cells,\\n    \\n    762\\n    00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:43,080\\n    the superstars of the adaptive immune system.\\n    \\n    763\\n    00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:47,760\\n    However, once we reach puberty, the thymus begins to shrink.\\n    \\n    764\\n    00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,880\\n    It is replaced by fatty tissue\\n    \\n    765\\n    00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,080\\n    and eventually stops producing new T cells.\\n    \\n    766\\n    00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,440\\n    Once we've used them up, our bodies become more susceptible\\n    \\n    767\\n    00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,600\\n    to pathogens and to age related diseases like cancer,\\n    \\n    768\\n    00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,760\\n    stroke and dementia.\\n    \\n    769\\n    00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,960\\n    When I saw that you could use\\n    \\n    770\\n    00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:14,640\\n    growth hormone to regrow the thymus and take immune system function\\n    \\n    771\\n    00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:19,200\\n    that was down to about 20% of the young immune system function\\n    \\n    772\\n    00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,720\\n    all the way back up to 100% of youthful function.\\n    \\n    773\\n    00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,640\\n    I just thought we have to do something about this.\\n    \\n    774\\n    00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,200\\n    But nobody took any action.\\n    \\n    775\\n    00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:32,440\\n    So I did an experiment on myself and I regrew my own thymus.\\n    \\n    776\\n    00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,320\\n    He published a scientific paper\\n    \\n    777\\n    00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:41,840\\n    that described one person and that was himself.\\n    \\n    778\\n    00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,840\\n    In 2016, the trial was repeated.\\n    \\n    779\\n    00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:51,360\\n    This time, a total of nine test subjects renewed their thymus.\\n    \\n    780\\n    00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,880\\n    They suspected the\\n    \\n    781\\n    00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:57,200\\n    treatment was having a positive effect on the whole body.\\n    \\n    782\\n    00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:01,040\\n    But how could he prove it?\\n    \\n    783\\n    00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,040\\n    This person came to me and said,\\n    \\n    784\\n    00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:07,320\\n    And you help me to analyze a treatment.\\n    \\n    785\\n    00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,160\\n    And the minute\\n    \\n    786\\n    00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,600\\n    he said the word thymus rejuvenation, I already said yes, you know.\\n    \\n    787\\n    00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:15,040\\n    Steve Horvath compared blood samples\\n    \\n    788\\n    00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,520\\n    from the test subjects before and after treatment.\\n    \\n    789\\n    00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,120\\n    And he was just as amazed,\\n    \\n    790\\n    00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:24,120\\n    if not more amazed as we were about the results.\\n    \\n    791\\n    00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,840\\n    If they are confirmed, it will be a sensation.\\n    \\n    792\\n    00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:32,960\\n    The original intention was get rid of the fat of the thymus.\\n    \\n    793\\n    00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,480\\n    This treatment had a side effect and unexpected side effect.\\n    \\n    794\\n    00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,520\\n    It really rejuvenated the methylation,\\n    \\n    795\\n    00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,640\\n    the epigenetic clock and.\\n    \\n    796\\n    00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,240\\n    All nine test subjects\\n    \\n    797\\n    00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:49,440\\n    turn their epigenetic clocks back by around 18 months and\\n    \\n    798\\n    00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,520\\n    a year of treatment.\\n    \\n    799\\n    00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,400\\n    That means they\\n    \\n    800\\n    00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,520\\n    had essentially reversed their biological age\\n    \\n    801\\n    00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:59,240\\n    by two and a half years.\\n    \\n    802\\n    00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:03,360\\n    We began to get reports from some of the people in the trial\\n    \\n    803\\n    00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,400\\n    that I feel great.\\n    \\n    804\\n    00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,600\\n    You know, I feel so energetic now.\\n    \\n    805\\n    00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:12,040\\n    I feel my mind is working faster than it's worked before.\\n    \\n    806\\n    00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:16,280\\n    Before this trial was over, this volunteer says, you know, my\\n    \\n    807\\n    00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:20,400\\n    my wife has been telling me that my hair's growing and dark again.\\n    \\n    808\\n    00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,240\\n    And I said, really?\\n    \\n    809\\n    00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,280\\n    That's

I think I will be.\\n\\n20\\n00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,480\\nI think, you know, I do want to live a full and healthy life.\\n\\n22\\n00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:12,720\\nSo I think whatever number I can live until that time, that guarantees me to have a very healthy life.\\n\\n23\\n00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:20,880\\nI love the number I wrote about earlier.\\n\\n23\\n00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,960\\nWake up early just because this is important for my health to do this.\\n\\n24\\n00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,280\\nSo I do it.\\n\\n25\\n00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,360\\nThat's really going to be consistent in your sleep schedule.\\n\\n26\\n00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,760\\nIt's easy for me to be consistent with waking up five.\\n\\n27\\n00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,800\\nThere's sort of some nice quiet time and.\\n\\n28\\n00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,840\\nYeah, I mean, it's, it's, it's so I do it.\\n\\n30\\n00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:58,640\\nI live consistency because that's really important thing for your circadian rhythms.\\n\\n31\\n00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,600\\nNina Keira first became interested in longevity research when she was 12.\\n\\n31\\n00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,640\\nNow the teenager is one of the scenes rising stars.\\n\\n33\\n00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:17,840\\nNina stands for a generation that takes a new view of aging that wants to see aging eradicated.\\n\\n34\\n00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,360\\nWhen she's not in school, Nina holds talks around the world.\\n\\n34\\n00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,720\\nShe's launched a small startup with a couple of friends.\\n\\n36\\n00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,320\\nThe group searches for scientific clues on how to crack the aging code.\\n\\n37\\n00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:51,920\\nYeah, but yeah, I can work on one of our proteins is probably involved with that process in some way, so we could weigh how much that protein is involved in that process and try to give an estimate even if we're not adding a whole new protein involved with that process.\\n\\n38\\n00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,080\\nYeah, I think that definitely something that we could that's useful to measure.\\n\\n39\\n00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,720\\nMy grandfather did have a form of dementia that was a big problem and I want to do something with that.\\n\\n40\\n00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:07,320\\nOne in six women get dementia after the age of 65 and on one in ten men, which is a lot of people when you think about it.\\n\\n40\\n00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:07,920\\nRight.\\n\\n41\\n00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,120\\nIt's diseases that you previously thought were inevitable.\\n\\n43\\n00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:26,000\\nSo we thought maybe we'd have drugs to alleviate the pain or to solve one particular type of disease from occurring, but never sort of to, you know, look at the root cause of these diseases and take it from there.\\n\\n44\\n00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,280\\nEach animal species has in certain ways an expiration date in a mouse.\\n\\n44\\n00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,440\\nIt's less than five years in the bowhead whale.\\n\\n45\\n00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,560\\nIt's 211 years in humans, it's 122.\\n\\n46\\n00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,440\\nEach species has a time that's kind of a allocated to it.\\n\\n48\\n00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,280\\nAnd the question is, why is that in nature?\\n\\n49\\n00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,360\\nDeath is a normal part of life, but can we humans push this biological age limit?\\n\\n49\\n00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,840\\nHuman life expectancy has risen steadily in recent history.\\n\\n50\\n00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,880\\nBack in ancient Rome, it was just 25 years.\\n\\n51\\n00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,080\\nBy the Middle Ages, it was still only 35.\\n\\n52\\n00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,440\\nNow we live into our seventies.\\n\\n54\\n00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:19,080\\nOn average, medical advances and better living conditions are enabling us to get older and older.\\n\\n54\\n00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,600\\nBut can we extend our lifespan indefinitely?\\n\\n55\\n00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:37,480\\nAnd would we really want to?\\n\\n56\\n00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,680\\nIf you believe in evolution and.\\n\\n58\\n00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:50,640\\nLots of people want to live forever and they wonder if we can reverse or slow down the aging process in.\\n\\n58\\n00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,800\\nAn unkind.\\n\\n60\\n00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:04,120\\nHistory tells us so much about violence, death and dying, but it also touches on reincarnation and life.\\n\\n60\\n00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,960\\nIt's a hugely popular thing.\\n\\n61\\n00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,360\\nImmortality is a topic that will never die.\\n\\n63\\n00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,000\\nIs abolition in Germany.\\n\\n63\\n00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,560\\nThere's a famous painting, The Fountain of Youth.\\n\\n65\\n00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:27,080\\nAnd on the painting you see all the old men and women, particularly taking their clothes off and getting into the fountain of youth and swimming across to the other side and emerging young and healthy on the other side.\\n\\n66\\n00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:33,080\\nAnd then going off to the tents and dressing and then having a wonderful dinner together with plenty of wine.\\n\\n67\\n00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:40,360\\nAnd it's it's man's age old dream to be able to reverse aging.\\n\\n68\\n00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,440\\nHe says this fountain of youth has become an allegory in biomedical research.\\n\\n69\\n00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,400\\nIt's no longer just about eating a healthy diet and leading a balanced lifestyle.\\n\\n70\\n00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:56,680\\nWe want to make more serious adjustments and we can take pills or get injections and so on, and we'll end up living longer.\\n\\n71\\n00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:06,240\\nThe idea of the fountain of youth that's outside me that I can jump into is shifted to a fountain that's put inside me, injected into me.\\n\\n71\\n00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,800\\nAnd it's an opposite.\\n\\n72\\n00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,080\\nWe are closer to finding the fountain of youth than ever before.\\n\\n73\\n00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,200\\nBut what if aging were kind of program?\\n\\n75\\n00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:29,160\\nA program we could hack into an initial clue as to how humans might be reprogramed.\\n\\n75\\n00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,680\\nLeads to an unassuming setting in Central America.\\n\\n77\\n00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:54,360\\nAnd I've lived in Costa Rica since 1972 and just completely fell in love with Costa Rica.\\n\\n78\\n00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:04,560\\nThe peninsula of Nicoya is a place where people age very well and long.\\n\\n78\\n00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,600\\nI think about it all the time.\\n\\n80\\n00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:17,280\\nI think about it all the time because it's really mysterious and they themselves can not give you any clues as to why you ask them.\\n\\n80\\n00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,680\\nAnd they say, I have no idea.\\n\\n81\\n00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,000\\nIt just is what it is.\\n\\n82\\n00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,120\\nBut yet we are more curious and we want to know more.\\n\\n84\\n00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,400\\nAna Gayle Glen takes care of some of the region's centenarians.\\n\\n85\\n00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:44,280\\nThe residents of Costa Rica's Nicoya Peninsula not only live longer but stay healthy for longer to.\\n\\n85\\n00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,880\\nSo much time.\\n\\n86\\n00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:51,760\\nHuh?\\n\\n87\\n00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:57,480\\nI'm leaving Guatemala and daniel nati.\\n\\n88\\n00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,040\\nSocorro is 91.\\n\\n90\\n00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:05,800\\nPeople here often live to be over 90, many to over 100.\\n\\n90\\n00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,360\\nWhat is in your state?\\n\\n91\\n00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,600\\nThese are herbs you use to heal diseases associated.\\n\\n92\\n00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,600\\nThat's right.\\n\\n93\\n00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,760\\nWhat's your health?\\n\\n95\\n00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,640\\nLots of people around the world want to know how to live a long and healthy life.\\n\\n95\\n00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,360\\nWhat's your advice?\\n\\n97\\n00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:27,560\\nThey're not going to have a controlled live for many years.\\n\\n98\\n00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:34,440\\nGo mad, scramble, eat a healthy diet and lead a peaceful, stress free life.\\n\\n98\\n00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,160\\nWhy eggs?\\n\\n99\\n00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,240\\nOh, lots of vitamins.\\n\\n100\\n00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,320\\nUh huh.\\n\\n101\\n00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,760\\nGuess she's napping.\\n\\n102\\n00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,640\\nWhen a person eats lots of cheese, their heart won't suffer.\\n\\n103\\n00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,680\\nMhm.\\n\\n105\\n00:09:47,760 --> 00:10:00,120\\nNo, it's as though this area was very, very distantly removed from the mainland, so to speak.\\n\\n105\\n00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,960\\nIt's a peninsula.\\n\\n106\\n00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,920\\nIt's still connected.\\n\\n107\\n00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,480\\nBut our roads were bad.\\n\\n108\\n00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,520\\nCommunication didn't exist.\\n\\n110\\n00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:10,520\\nPeople survived here on what they planted, on what their parents taught them, how to survive.\\n\\n111\\n00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,440\\nThere was no pharmacy to go to that smells so good or lack of wine.\\n\\n111\\n00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,920\\nThis herb treats fever and all kinds of things.\\n\\n112\\n00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,200\\nMy opinion.\\n\\n114\\n00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:41,000\\nThe fact that people in Nicoya live to be older than average went largely unnoticed until one scientist stumbled onto some unusual data some years ago.\\n\\n114\\n00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,960\\nBefore my second professional initiative.\\n\\n116\\n00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,840\\nI was initially an economist, but it never really felt like the right field for me.\\n\\n116\\n00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,880\\nEventually, I found my knees and demographics.\\n\\n117\\n00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,160\\nIt's much more precise with clear cut rules.\\n\\n119\\n00:10:53,840 --> 00:11:00,920\\nIt's black and. White and they or they manage the got swallowed.\\n\\n120\\n00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:07,080\\nBy sheer coincidence, we discovered that mortality rates in the region were much lower than the rest of the country.\\n\\n120\\n00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,280\\nYou know already much importance here.\\n\\n121\\n00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,720\\nInitially, I didn't pay much attention to it.\\n\\n122\\n00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,400\\nWell, my paper I.\\n\\n124\\n00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:20,080\\nWhen I presented my findings at a conference, there was a lot of skepticism about whether it was really so.\\n\\n124\\n00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,840\\nIn Costa Rica, fragmented, less costly.\\n\\n125\\n00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,120\\nAnd I think they don't want that.\\n\\n127\\n00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:30,200\\nPerson, but one person from the audience approached me afterwards and said it's because it's a blue zone.\\n\\n127\\n00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,320\\nIn some way.\\n\\n128\\n00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,840\\nAnd at that moment, I realized that Nicoya really was a special place.\\n\\n129\\n00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,200\\nYou know, local career.\\n\\n131\\n00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:46,800\\nNicoya Five so-called blue zones have been identified so far on our planet.\\n\\n132\\n00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:53,560\\nThese are locations where an unusually high percentage of the population lives very long.\\n\\n133\\n00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,600\\nMen in Nicoya have the world's highest life expectancy.\\n\\n134\\n00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:09,440\\nAn 80 year old male here is likely to outlive his contemporaries elsewhere by an average 8.2 years.\\n\\n134\\n00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,560\\nWe're going off.\\n\\n136\\n00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:26,360\\nBut why is it the diet rich in fruit in Nicoya?\\n\\n136\\n00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,920\\nOr does religious faith explain it fairly?\\n\\n137\\n00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,880\\nThere wasn't any real data.\\n\\n138\\n00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,480\\nThat said that. The real mantra of Yeah.\\n\\n139\\n00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,120\\nThat's what I'm almost product guy.\\n\\n141\\n00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:42,880\\nThe question is, is it genetics or is it lifestyle being?\\n\\n141\\n00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,560\\nPeople in Costa Rica say probably the good I me, the.\\n\\n142\\n00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,160\\nAnd think I used to joke most of it.\\n\\n144\\n00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:03,480\\nWe carried out a study to see what happens when people leave Nicoya and what happens when people from other parts of the country move to Nicoya.\\n\\n145\\n00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:08,280\\nParties in price of evicting Nicoya we must get.\\n\\n146\\n00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:14,920\\nWe found out that neither of these groups achieved the same longevity as those who are born and spend their whole lives here.\\n\\n146\\n00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,000\\nEven on three, ten, 20.\\n\\n147\\n00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,320\\nIn blue zones, eating seems to proceed more slowly.\\n\\n148\\n00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,440\\nThan people come from.\\n\\n150\\n00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,720\\nThe environment and the lifestyle appear to positively impact human biology.\\n\\n150\\n00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,280\\nFor me.\\n\\n152\\n00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:55,320\\nBut how exactly and will this help us crack the aging code?\\n\\n152\\n00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,480\\nI'm molecular biologist, biochemist.\\n\\n153\\n00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,760\\nI'm interested in understanding the origin of diseases.\\n\\n154\\n00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,480\\nThe majority of diseases are those associated with the aging process.\\n\\n155\\n00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,920\\nSo I'm interested in understanding why we age the molecular level.\\n\\n157\\n00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,880\\nI wanted to devote my life to understand the origins of cancer on aging.\\n\\n157\\n00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,880\\nI thought telomerase could be the key.\\n\\n159\\n00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:26,280\\nThe human body consists of around 37 trillion cells, some last a few days.\\n\\n159\\n00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,240\\nOthers live for years.\\n\\n160\\n00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,920\\nWe constantly produce new cells to replace the old ones.\\n\\n161\\n00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:40,320\\nIt's a process that involves duplication.\\n\\n163\\n00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:46,280\\nBefore cell division can take place, the chromosomes in the cell nucleus have to be duplicated.\\n\\n164\\n00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,760\\nThe DNA double helix they consist of is unwound and separated into strands.\\n\\n164\\n00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,760\\nEach strand then becomes a template for a new one.\\n\\n166\\n00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:07,760\\nThe ends of the chromosomes, which are especially prone to replication errors, are protected by telomeres, which are sequences of non-coding DNA.\\n\\n167\\n00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:16,200\\nBut with every cell division, these safety caps become shorter and.\\n\\n168\\n00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:28,080\\nLess charged.\\n\\n169\\n00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:36,800\\nI feel charged with that.\\n\\n170\\n00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:45,040\\nThe issue of the telomeres.\\n\\n170\\n00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,280\\nImagine this shoelace is our chromosome.\\n\\n172\\n00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,280\\nSo this part of the shoelace is the DNA where the genetic information is.\\n\\n173\\n00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:58,560\\nAnd this little plastic part, which is very important to protect the shoelace would be the telomere.\\n\\n174\\n00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:04,920\\nSo the telomeres are very important to protect our chromosomes, to protect the DNA.\\n\\n174\\n00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,440\\nAs we age, the telomeres become shorter and shorter.\\n\\n176\\n00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:13,320\\nThis is because every time that we have a damage, the cells have to multiply to regenerate the damage.\\n\\n177\\n00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,000\\nAnd this shortens the delivers to the cell division of the cell multiplication.\\n\\n178\\n00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,840\\nSo at the end, the telomeres become so short that we don't have any more active them.\\n\\n179\\n00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:33,480\\nSo now our DNA is unprotected and this is leading to aging, is leading to disease, and ultimately will be leading to this cell division.\\n\\n180\\n00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:45,320\\nAnd the rate of telomere shortening may be influenced by our lifestyle, smoking, stress, environmental pollutants and poor nutrition are all negative factors.\\n\\n181\\n00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:54,120\\nSome researchers believe living in harmony with the natural world has a positive effect.\\n\\n181\\n00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,760\\nYou know, Sartre's sucking.\\n\\n183\\n00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:01,520\\nWe couldn't carry out experiments like this in Costa Rica, so we sent our samples away.\\n\\n184\\n00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:06,160\\nWhen the results of this collaboration came back, we realized we'd found something.\\n\\n184\\n00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,440\\nLost in a similar anarchy.\\n\\n185\\n00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:07,840\\nOkay.\\n\\n186\\n00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,040\\nAnd then contra las personas. Nicole.\\n\\n187\\n00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,800\\nKaya, DNA.\\n\\n189\\n00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:18,360\\nPeople from Nicoya have longer telomeres, significantly longer telomeres than people in the rest of the country.\\n\\n189\\n00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,400\\nThis tiny piece.\\n\\n191\\n00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:31,280\\nScientists like Maria Blasco are exploring ways of artificially lengthening telomeres in order to slow the aging process.\\n\\n191\\n00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,440\\nBut this does come at a risk.\\n\\n192\\n00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,120\\nTo your father by is does.\\n\\n194\\n00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:41,720\\nThe danger is that cancer can develop because cancer cells are immortal and we're walking a fine line here.\\n\\n195\\n00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,520\\nDo we tell the cells to resist their preprogramed cell death and risk that it will result in cancer?\\n\\n196\\n00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:54,800\\nOr do we leave things to run their natural course and let the cells die when their time is up and there's no proliferation?\\n\\n197\\n00:17:54,800 --> 00:18:00,360\\nAnd we just accept that our final destination is around 120 to 125 years.\\n\\n197\\n00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,400\\nOf unsuccessful, not from one scientist.\\n\\n198\\n00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,560\\nBut of course we all know the answer.\\n\\n200\\n00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:12,000\\nHumans want to test the boundaries and see if they can really live to 150 or 300 and.\\n\\n200\\n00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,640\\nHow far can we go?\\n\\n202\\n00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:30,280\\nHow much should science interfere in nature's blueprint?\\n\\n203\\n00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:36,720\\nWe don't have to necessarily accept current biological limitations because that's what we do as a species.\\n\\n203\\n00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,400\\nWe're problem solvers.\\n\\n204\\n00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,120\\nWe don't just sit around and get rained on, we build houses.\\n\\n206\\n00:18:42,760 --> 00:19:03,960\\nSo we may want to transcend normal biology at some point and set goals for ourself beyond just normal concepts of health.\\n\\n207\\n00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:10,440\\nWhen you wonder about what is aging, you end up asking how tissues repair.\\n\\n207\\n00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:16,400\\nThis is a process that is still poorly understood.\\n\\n209\\n00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:28,080\\nCells progressively accumulate damage they age, but when they reach a certain threshold, they undergo a switch.\\n\\n209\\n00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,680\\nThey become senescent.\\n\\n211\\n00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,600\\nI like to describe them as zombies because, you know, they're like in a middle stage between alive and dead.\\n\\n212\\n00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,080\\nThey're not either, but they're at the same time they're really damaging.\\n\\n213\\n00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:51,320\\nSenescent cells produce an alarm signal so that the other cells in the body realize that there is a damage there and they go and they repair.\\n\\n214\\n00:19:52,080 --> 00:20:00,160\\nThe problem is that as we get older, these repair says they are also old and they don't go and they don't repair.\\n\\n214\\n00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,960\\nAnd we accumulate these cells that are constantly producing this alarm.\\n\\n215\\n00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,440\\nThis is a phenomenon that is called inflammation.\\n\\n217\\n00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:22,440\\nAll people have inflammatory signals elevated caused by their own senescent cells that are not eliminated.\\n\\n218\\n00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:34,800\\nWe are trying to crack the code of these senescent cells, trying to understand their vulnerabilities, how to kill them without killing the non senescent cells.\\n\\n219\\n00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:41,720\\nIn some initial experiments, Manuel Serrano and his team were able to show that mice lived longer.\\n\\n219\\n00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,960\\nOnce they're senescent or zombie cells were eliminated.\\n\\n220\\n00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,600\\nBut that does not guarantee eternal youth.\\n\\n221\\n00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,600\\nIt's a double edged sword.\\n\\n223\\n00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:59,280\\nSenescent cells play also very good, an important role, for example, in wound healing.\\n\\n224\\n00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:04,240\\nIf you have a wound, if you don't have senescence, the wound will never hear.\\n\\n225\\n00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:10,160\\nSo you could have a treatment that removes all senescent cells and suddenly you have terrible side effects.\\n\\n225\\n00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,280\\nIt just means we need more research, you know.\\n\\n227\\n00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:21,240\\nResearch into telomeres and zombie cells are only two approaches in the race for longevity.\\n\\n228\\n00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:33,440\\nAnd one thing is certain whoever cracks the code is set to earn millions.\\n\\n229\\n00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:40,760\\nAll right, so, guys, how do I look?\\n\\n229\\n00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:45,440\\nDo I look old?\\n\\n230\\n00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,680\\nSo you've seen what we did.\\n\\n232\\n00:21:46,680 --> 00:22:04,680\\nWe've announced that $255 million raise is the largest raise in our industry to date.\\n\\n233\\n00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:13,960\\nHong Kong has the highest life expectancy on the planet today, which is no surprise because longevity is very often correlate it with wealth.\\n\\n233\\n00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,320\\nAnd here people are filthy rich.\\n\\n235\\n00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:28,760\\nWelfare is increasing dramatically in the region, in China, in mainland people who were peasants just 35 years ago, they are now multimillionaires.\\n\\n235\\n00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:39,480\\nAnd people demand longevity.\\n\\n237\\n00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:52,040\\nAs a CEO of a biotech company, I tried to collaborate with a lot of people and I tried to contribute as many projects as possible.\\n\\n238\\n00:22:52,040 --> 00:23:03,280\\nLife Clinic is a very fun concept where the founder is decided to bridge the Starbucks concept with preventative medical care.\\n\\n239\\n00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:15,240\\nYou choose a cocktail of all kinds of nutrients that will be going into your blood while you are sipping on a juice.\\n\\n239\\n00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,920\\nThey offer IV drips and all kinds of other interventions.\\n\\n240\\n00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,280\\nI cannot vouch for some of them, man.\\n\\n241\\n00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,520\\nYeah, I. Be. Correct.\\n\\n242\\n00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,360\\nCorrect.\\n\\n243\\n00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,720\\nIn Hong Kong? Correct.\\n\\n245\\n00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:36,400\\nAnything geared at increasing life expectancy already promises megabucks, dubious wonder.\\n\\n245\\n00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,240\\nDrugs and IV drips are readily available.\\n\\n247\\n00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,560\\nThe region is also attracting biotech companies from around the world.\\n\\n248\\n00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:59,040\\nMoney from wealthy investors has created a much hyped start up scene longevity research is Hong Kong's new dotcom boom.\\n\\n248\\n00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,640\\nAnd.\\n\\n250\\n00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:06,960\\nA new development is that the research is being carried out with business startup methods, with massive capital.\\n\\n251\\n00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:13,800\\nWe're investing or pumping funds into it, we're throwing cash at it, and that will invariably result in a product.\\n\\n251\\n00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,800\\nIt's an infallible economic model.\\n\\n252\\n00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,200\\nIt will always work. To.\\n\\n253\\n00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,920\\nReach a market.\\n\\n254\\n00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,440\\nThere's a huge market for these new companies.\\n\\n255\\n00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,160\\nOne really is to have treatments for for diseases.\\n\\n257\\n00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:32,680\\nSo that's where the big bucks are.\\n\\n258\\n00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:36,960\\nI'm willing to experiment on myself because there is a lot of data on me.\\n\\n259\\n00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:45,080\\nI'm one of the most well studied humans on the planet now, and I try to optimize for high performance at this point in time.\\n\\n259\\n00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,360\\nI try to perform at my peak.\\n\\n260\\n00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,320\\nI've tried rapamycin in the past.\\n\\n262\\n00:24:51,320 --> 00:25:03,720\\nIt's very often referred to as a magic drug in longevity, in not in the same line as metformin, but it's likely to be stronger than the form and it's not without side effects.\\n\\n263\\n00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,960\\nSo there is a chance that you are going to see Mucositis and a few others.\\n\\n264\\n00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:13,640\\nSo we decided to try it on ourself in a very controlled mode.\\n\\n264\\n00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,680\\nAny side effects?\\n\\n265\\n00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,080\\nNot at all. Zero side effects.\\n\\n267\\n00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,800\\nWhen I was exercising in the hotel, I got some serious muscle mass increases here.\\n\\n267\\n00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,600\\nIt's great.\\n\\n268\\n00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,800\\nI actually, as a cook.\\n\\n269\\n00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,920\\nAll right.\\n\\n270\\n00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,520\\nYeah, that's me.\\n\\n272\\n00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:37,040\\nSo that's for the rest of this.\\n\\n272\\n00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,520\\nOh, thank you. This.\\n\\n273\\n00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,000\\nThank you so much for coming here.\\n\\n274\\n00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,520\\nYes. Your whole life literally.\\n\\n275\\n00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,840\\nTo a life.\\n\\n276\\n00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:59,520\\nRapamycin, metformin, energy boosters.\\n\\n277\\n00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,600\\nDo any of these substances really help?\\n\\n278\\n00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:23,160\\nHow can their effectiveness be tested?\\n\\n280\\n00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:31,560\\nI was interested in anti-aging signs since I was a teenager growing up in Frankfurt, Germany.\\n\\n281\\n00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:42,000\\nI had a group of friends who were very interested in science, and at some point we realized the most important challenge of our generation is to prolong life.\\n\\n281\\n00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,480\\nWe had very lofty goals.\\n\\n282\\n00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,360\\nI need to tell you, you know, we have crazy goals.\\n\\n283\\n00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:53,640\\nWe wanted to study physics, math, biology, chemistry.\\n\\n284\\n00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,920\\nAlso, we wanted to do space travel.\\n\\n286\\n00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:06,360\\nAnd then the minute you think of space travel, you realize that you will need decades, you know, to travel for centuries.\\n\\n287\\n00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:19,200\\nAnd so we felt we really need to solve this problem first to extend our lifespan before we can even think about space travel one day by accident.\\n\\n287\\n00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,040\\nReally, because I did somebody a favor.\\n\\n288\\n00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,160\\nI analyze this methylation data.\\n\\n290\\n00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:31,800\\nI immediately recognized that epigenetics or methylation is really the data source that has a tremendous signal for aging.\\n\\n291\\n00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:41,240\\nHe was able to find clusters of genes whose methylation state could tell you how old you were at a particular time.\\n\\n292\\n00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:56,080\\nThe amazing thing about this is that it works from the day you're created as a fertilized egg cell all the way until the day that you die.\\n\\n293\\n00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:03,480\\nThere are more than 200 distinct cell types in the human body, although they all contain the same DNA.\\n\\n294\\n00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,760\\nThere is a mechanism that tells the cell whether it is a skin cell or a liver cell.\\n\\n294\\n00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:14,320\\nFor example, called epigenetics.\\n\\n296\\n00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:25,040\\nThis involves information that sits on the DNA resulting in genes being switched on or off.\\n\\n297\\n00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:35,640\\nPerhaps the best known type of epigenetic change is methylation, the addition or removal of methyl groups on the DNA strand.\\n\\n297\\n00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:41,600\\nThese changes continue to take place throughout our lives.\\n\\n298\\n00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,600\\nThe DNA contains four letters.\\n\\n300\\n00:28:43,600 --> 00:29:07,560\\nA CTG methylation sometimes attaches to the letter C and modifies it similar to an omelet by keeping track very carefully which parts of the DNA gain, methylation or lose methylation we can measure aging methylation can be sort of like the rust that accumulates.\\n\\n300\\n00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,040\\nBy measuring the amount of rust, we can determine age.\\n\\n302\\n00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:21,280\\nSo if we have an hourglass, the passage of time is measured by how the sand how much sand accumulates at the bottom.\\n\\n303\\n00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:28,880\\nThe DNA molecule, though, has 28 million different hourglass because we have 28 million.\\n\\n303\\n00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,440\\nLet us see in our DNA.\\n\\n305\\n00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:42,160\\nSo by averaging the measurements of 28 million hour glasses, you arrive at a very accurate measure of age.\\n\\n306\\n00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:47,320\\nThis is one of the most insightful discoveries in the history of mankind.\\n\\n306\\n00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,200\\nDoes we like the invention of the wheel?\\n\\n307\\n00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,040\\nWhat is.\\n\\n308\\n00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,200\\nThat? Definitely as a turning point in aging?\\n\\n310\\n00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:59,000\\nI think that was just a very, very important point where we realized, hey, we can measure aging now.\\n\\n311\\n00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:06,680\\nThe epigenetic clock has revolutionized research into aging with a simple DNA sample.\\n\\n312\\n00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:20,920\\nAnyone's biologic age can be determined, however, that can produce some nasty surprises.\\n\\n313\\n00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:30,040\\nMy name is Marcus Horvath, and I am Steve's identical twin brother is my older twin.\\n\\n314\\n00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:35,880\\nBrother is 5 minutes older than me, however, only at birth.\\n\\n315\\n00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:56,800\\nWe measured our epigenetic clock a couple of years ago, and then according to one of the clocks, I was actually four years older than him, which is not necessarily good news.\\n\\n316\\n00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:05,360\\nThose technologies are enabling us to accelerate aging research dramatically by not waiting until you die.\\n\\n316\\n00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,400\\nWe can now measure where you.\\n\\n317\\n00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,880\\nAre in life.\\n\\n319\\n00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:16,680\\nAnd measure how different interventions affect that prediction.\\n\\n320\\n00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:23,920\\nWe picked this up and applied a to the same problem and developed many, many Asian clocks.\\n\\n321\\n00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:28,800\\nAbove all, the quest for eternal life requires personal biological data.\\n\\n321\\n00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,600\\nThe digital devices we use every day can provide mountains of it.\\n\\n323\\n00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:39,240\\nBig data is currently one of the most promising approaches to cracking the aging code.\\n\\n324\\n00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:49,480\\nUnlike conventional medicine or artificial intelligence can scour the data for hidden patterns to help prevent diseases from developing in the first place.\\n\\n325\\n00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:54,480\\nThis situation looks very similar to fast on the subway.\\n\\n326\\n00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:03,080\\nSo when you pull your wallet and you don't know who, every human on the train looks the same.\\n\\n326\\n00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:03,840\\nThey move.\\n\\n327\\n00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:11,280\\nThey move in different patterns.\\n\\n329\\n00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:23,240\\nSo you need to observe many, many of those scenarios in many subways globally to develop a really precise algorithm for catching a thief on the subway.\\n\\n330\\n00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:31,120\\nAnd you train AI technologies to recognize those thieves and predict human behavior.\\n\\n331\\n00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:44,160\\nAnd I think nowadays in advanced countries like mainland China, there are video monitoring techniques that allow you automatically to recognize the fast movement.\\n\\n332\\n00:32:45,200 --> 00:33:01,320\\nSo it's very similar to recognize those proteins that misbehave during aging and cause trouble.\\n\\n332\\n00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:01,560\\nYeah.\\n\\n334\\n00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:06,600\\nSo what we are going to do now, we're going to solve a disease very quickly.\\n\\n334\\n00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,120\\nWe're going to solve the Crohn's disease.\\n\\n335\\n00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,840\\nA.I.\\n\\n337\\n00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:21,800\\nis already poised to increase our life expectancy, or so we're told, at the touch of a button.\\n\\n338\\n00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:40,400\\nStart ups can run through thousands of possible outcomes and quickly discover new medications, all based on data from users of apps like the one that Alex Zhavoronkov has developed.\\n\\n339\\n00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:47,040\\nWe recently received $255 million from a group of ultra elite investors.\\n\\n340\\n00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:54,040\\nSo it turned out that we are in the right place, in the right time, with the right technology.\\n\\n340\\n00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:57,080\\nI think that very soon we will see guys like Amazon.\\n\\n342\\n00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:21,000\\nI'm waiting for those guys to react, guys like Facebook, guys that produce video games, Netflix, those people who steal your time, they will come back and try to figure out how to make more time so you can wasted on their product.\\n\\n342\\n00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,640\\nSilicon Valley is already on board.\\n\\n343\\n00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:29,400\\nIn 2013, Google founded a secretive biotech venture called Calico.\\n\\n345\\n00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:35,960\\nIts longevity research is carried out behind closed doors with nearly unlimited resources.\\n\\n346\\n00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:50,840\\nA group backed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has also burst onto the anti-aging scene with hundreds of millions in funding Altos Labs is recruiting top scientists from around the globe to join the project.\\n\\n346\\n00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,360\\nThey include Steve Horvath and Manuel Serrano.\\n\\n347\\n00:34:54,920 --> 00:35:02,920\\nThere's even a longevity clinic in the pipeline.\\n\\n349\\n00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:18,360\\nDespite the big players jockeying for position, there are still opportunities for smaller projects like Startup Bio Biotin, which is working flat out to develop a self-test to measure aging.\\n\\n350\\n00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:27,760\\nBiotin is a group of people who are working towards the goal of extending healthspan and eradicating aging with its users.\\n\\n351\\n00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:33,760\\nWe're all just sort of a group of people with a sort of a fascination for age related diseases and aging itself.\\n\\n351\\n00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:37,800\\nWe have sort of focused on this idea of biological age itself.\\n\\n353\\n00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,120\\nWe tell you what your biological age is in sort of an accessible and cheap manner.\\n\\n354\\n00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,800\\nAnd a lot of biological age tests currently are very pricey, which is fine.\\n\\n355\\n00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:52,840\\nI mean, it makes total sense, especially for Biohackers and people who are way more interested in the very deep signs of aging.\\n\\n356\\n00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:58,440\\nBut we just want to give and general encapsulation of your aging process to the general population.\\n\\n357\\n00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:10,640\\nNina's clock is designed to determine age based on proteins in saliva, although she can only work in a lab once she turns 16, she's found ways to access the latest data.\\n\\n358\\n00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,640\\nGo to research paper website and they are supplementary files that we were able to download and see their data.\\n\\n358\\n00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,600\\nSo that's really cool.\\n\\n360\\n00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,800\\nSometimes when it comes to us working directly with labs, they send us the data personally.\\n\\n361\\n00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:32,280\\nThey tell us Here is the work we've done because it often helps them to in their projects.\\n\\n362\\n00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:41,320\\nYou know, people like Nina are taking advantage of a new paradigm, really, in which you can the data on your own data is available.\\n\\n362\\n00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,840\\nMy lab does that.\\n\\n363\\n00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:46,320\\nOn the one hand, I download data, but I also upload a lot of data.\\n\\n364\\n00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,160\\nI put millions of dollars worth of data

accelerate evolution ourself.\\n\\n429\\n00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:51,240\\nTo do this, we need to evolve and we need to change as humans as well.\\n\\n431\\n00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:57,560\\nThe the lack of any other side.\\n\\n431\\n00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,400\\nThat nature has no plan.\\n\\n432\\n00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,440\\nNature is a random thing, right?\\n\\n433\\n00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,400\\nBut it works.\\n\\n435\\n00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,200\\nNature's built up life on this planet over the last four and a half billion years.\\n\\n436\\n00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:18,000\\nAnd it is fine tuned and honed and optimized thanks to an unbelievable able degree of perfection.\\n\\n437\\n00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:31,800\\nSo you have to be a little bit careful about messing with Mother Nature.\\n\\n437\\n00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,280\\nBut.\\n\\n439\\n00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:52,320\\nOne of the interesting things about super centenarians and centenarians is that their immune systems last much better than the rest of us, which is clue as to the fact that you need to have a good immune system in order to stay alive a long time.\\n\\n440\\n00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:04,360\\nSteve Horvath is one of the scientists set to follow the call of Amazon boss Jeff Bezos.\\n\\n441\\n00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:10,640\\nBut before he embarks on that new task, he's focusing on another promising project.\\n\\n442\\n00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:19,200\\nIt's the so-called trim trial designed by his colleague Greg Fahy to reverse immune system aging.\\n\\n443\\n00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:25,320\\nHardly any other study in the field has prompted as much interest in recent times.\\n\\n444\\n00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:31,400\\nThe flow of immune cells plays a central role in fighting illness in our bodies.\\n\\n444\\n00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:36,440\\nBut there's a limited supply of these essential cells.\\n\\n446\\n00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:43,080\\nOur bodies, thymus gland, produces t cells, the superstars of the adaptive immune system.\\n\\n446\\n00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:47,760\\nHowever, once we reach puberty, the thymus begins to shrink.\\n\\n448\\n00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:54,080\\nIt is replaced by fatty tissue and eventually stops producing new T cells.\\n\\n449\\n00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:05,760\\nOnce we've used them up, our bodies become more susceptible to pathogens and to age related diseases like cancer, stroke and dementia.\\n\\n450\\n00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:22,720\\nWhen I saw that you could use growth hormone to regrow the thymus and take immune system function that was down to about 20% of the young immune system function all the way back up to 100% of youthful function.\\n\\n450\\n00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,640\\nI just thought we have to do something about this.\\n\\n451\\n00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,200\\nBut nobody took any action.\\n\\n452\\n00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:32,440\\nSo I did an experiment on myself and I regrew my own thymus.\\n\\n454\\n00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:41,840\\nHe published a scientific paper that described one person and that was himself.\\n\\n454\\n00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,840\\nIn 2016, the trial was repeated.\\n\\n455\\n00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:51,360\\nThis time, a total of nine test subjects renewed their thymus.\\n\\n457\\n00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:57,200\\nThey suspected the treatment was having a positive effect on the whole body.\\n\\n457\\n00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:01,040\\nBut how could he prove it?\\n\\n459\\n00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:07,320\\nThis person came to me and said, And you help me to analyze a treatment.\\n\\n460\\n00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,600\\nAnd the minute he said the word thymus rejuvenation, I already said yes, you know.\\n\\n461\\n00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:18,520\\nSteve Horvath compared blood samples from the test subjects before and after treatment.\\n\\n462\\n00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:24,120\\nAnd he was just as amazed, if not more amazed as we were about the results.\\n\\n462\\n00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,840\\nIf they are confirmed, it will be a sensation.\\n\\n463\\n00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:32,960\\nThe original intention was get rid of the fat of the thymus.\\n\\n464\\n00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,480\\nThis treatment had a side effect and unexpected side effect.\\n\\n466\\n00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:42,640\\nIt really rejuvenated the methylation, the epigenetic clock and.\\n\\n467\\n00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:50,520\\nAll nine test subjects turn their epigenetic clocks back by around 18 months and a year of treatment.\\n\\n468\\n00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:59,240\\nThat means they had essentially reversed their biological age by two and a half years.\\n\\n469\\n00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:05,400\\nWe began to get reports from some of the people in the trial that I feel great.\\n\\n469\\n00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,600\\nYou know, I feel so energetic now.\\n\\n470\\n00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:12,040\\nI feel my mind is working faster than it's worked before.\\n\\n472\\n00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:20,400\\nBefore this trial was over, this volunteer says, you know, my my wife has been telling me that my hair's growing and dark again.\\n\\n472\\n00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,240\\nAnd I said, really?\\n\\n473\\n00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,280\\nThat's interesting. Let's have a look.\\n\\n474\\n00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:28,600\\nSo we looked at his hair and boy, it was a big, very strong difference.\\n\\n475\\n00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:33,440\\nHis hair was darkening all over the place.\\n\\n477\\n00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:42,720\\nI need to say we are all very excited about it, but we are also very sober scientists.\\n\\n478\\n00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:48,680\\nYou know, and therefore, we always felt we desperately need a second validation study.\\n\\n479\\n00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:55,120\\nAnd that's really why I continue to work with Greg, why I become a study participant.\\n\\n480\\n00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:01,000\\nA third study with more test subjects aims to corroborate the original results.\\n\\n481\\n00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:10,640\\nIf successful, the famous regeneration could be the first scientifically proven anti-aging treatment for human beings.\\n\\n481\\n00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,720\\nBut the scientists need more data.\\n\\n483\\n00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:19,640\\nSteve Horvath and his brother have volunteered to take part in the trial as identical twins.\\n\\n483\\n00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,320\\nThey are ideal candidates.\\n\\n485\\n00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:27,600\\nSteve will get the rejuvenation treatment and Marcus will join the control group.\\n\\n485\\n00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,840\\nWe're now ready for your baseline testing.\\n\\n486\\n00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:35,680\\nAnd this is the testing that you do before entering the term X trial.\\n\\n488\\n00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:40,680\\nAnd then we'll assess you after 12 months of treatment and see how you fare. At that point.\\n\\n488\\n00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:41,480\\nThe first step is.\\n\\n490\\n00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:49,440\\nA functional test where you're literally just standing up and sitting back down as many times as you can within 30 seconds.\\n\\n490\\n00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,640\\nThe outcome for me and.\\n\\n492\\n00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:57,360\\nThe entire alliance, ever since we know that, no, I had a better breakfast and.\\n\\n493\\n00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:02,520\\nMaybe after 12 months of the term treatment, you'll be able to compete with that. All right.\\n\\n493\\n00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:04,840\\nAnd I'll give you a countdown.\\n\\n494\\n00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,200\\nOkay.
