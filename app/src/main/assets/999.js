(() => {
    const strings = `1
    00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,560
    What is aging?
    
    2
    00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,120
    Is it possible for us to affect it?
    
    3
    00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,720
    How much more can we do?
    
    4
    00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,480
    These are big questions they're going to take us to answers
    
    5
    00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,800
    that are going to be illuminating to mankind as a whole.
    
    6
    00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,480
    Aging has become a hot topic.
    
    7
    00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,000
    We are right now at the point where we can already develop strategies.
    
    8
    00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,160
    Collapsing angry.
    
    9
    00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,320
    Injections, stimulation methods, personal programs, pills.
    
    10
    00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,680
    We're in the midst of a seismic shift
    
    11
    00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,840
    that will open up possibilities for more healthy aging.
    
    12
    00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,160
    To live in.
    
    13
    00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,800
    There is something in the air and we can feel it.
    
    14
    00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,680
    And plenty of people already show you gold nuggets, you know,
    
    15
    00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,720
    and say There's gold here, you know?
    
    16
    00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,840
    Right now we're seeing a huge gold rush.
    
    17
    00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,040
    Once the proof of concept is established on
    
    18
    00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,240
    longevity, it will go viral.
    
    19
    00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,240
    My particular man.
    
    20
    00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,000
    The person who will live to 115,
    
    21
    00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,120
    has probably already been born when it's highly likely.
    
    22
    00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:57,280
    That this was this is more traumatic.
    
    23
    00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,120
    I'm 15 right now.
    
    24
    00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,640
    How old? I think I will be.
    
    25
    00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,480
    I think, you know, I do want to live a full and healthy life.
    
    26
    00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,920
    So I think whatever number I can live
    
    27
    00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,720
    until that time, that guarantees me to have a very healthy life.
    
    28
    00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,640
    I love the number
    
    29
    00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,880
    I wrote about earlier.
    
    30
    00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,960
    Wake up early just because this is important for my health to do this.
    
    31
    00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,280
    So I do it.
    
    32
    00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,360
    That's really going to be consistent in your sleep schedule.
    
    33
    00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,760
    It's easy for me to be consistent with waking up five.
    
    34
    00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,800
    There's sort of some nice quiet time and.
    
    35
    00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,840
    Yeah, I mean, it's, it's, it's so I do it.
    
    36
    00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,880
    I live consistency because that's really important thing for your
    
    37
    00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:58,640
    circadian rhythms.
    
    38
    00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,320
    Nina Keira first became
    
    39
    00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,600
    interested in longevity research when she was 12.
    
    40
    00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,640
    Now the teenager is one of the scenes rising stars.
    
    41
    00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,200
    Nina stands for a generation that takes a new view of aging
    
    42
    00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,840
    that wants to see aging eradicated.
    
    43
    00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,360
    When she's not in school,
    
    44
    00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,360
    Nina holds talks around the world.
    
    45
    00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,720
    She's launched a small startup with a couple of friends.
    
    46
    00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,400
    The group searches for scientific
    
    47
    00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,320
    clues on how to crack the aging code.
    
    48
    00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,800
    Yeah, but yeah, I can work on
    
    49
    00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,400
    one of our proteins is probably involved with that process in some way,
    
    50
    00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,400
    so we could weigh how much that protein is involved in that process
    
    51
    00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,800
    and try to give an estimate
    
    52
    00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,680
    even if we're not adding a whole new protein
    
    53
    00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,920
    involved with that process.
    
    54
    00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,520
    Yeah, I think that definitely something that we could that's useful
    
    55
    00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,080
    to measure.
    
    56
    00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,640
    My grandfather
    
    57
    00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,320
    did have a form of dementia
    
    58
    00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,720
    that was a big problem and I want to do something with that.
    
    59
    00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,080
    One in six women get dementia after the age of 65
    
    60
    00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,760
    and on one in ten men,
    
    61
    00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,320
    which is a lot of people when you think about it.
    
    62
    00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:07,920
    Right.
    
    63
    00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,120
    It's diseases that you previously thought were inevitable.
    
    64
    00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,360
    So we thought maybe we'd have drugs to alleviate the pain
    
    65
    00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,240
    or to solve one particular type of disease from occurring,
    
    66
    00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,640
    but never sort of to,
    
    67
    00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,800
    you know, look at the root cause of these diseases
    
    68
    00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
    and take it from there.
    
    69
    00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,440
    Each animal species
    
    70
    00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,280
    has in certain ways an expiration date in a mouse.
    
    71
    00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,440
    It's less than five years in the bowhead whale.
    
    72
    00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,560
    It's 211 years in humans, it's 122.
    
    73
    00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,440
    Each species has a time that's kind of a allocated to it.
    
    74
    00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,000
    And the question is, why is that
    
    75
    00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,280
    in nature?
    
    76
    00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,520
    Death is a normal part of life, but can we
    
    77
    00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,360
    humans push this biological age limit?
    
    78
    00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,840
    Human life expectancy has risen steadily in recent history.
    
    79
    00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,880
    Back in ancient Rome, it was just 25 years.
    
    80
    00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,080
    By the Middle Ages, it was still only 35.
    
    81
    00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,440
    Now we live into our seventies.
    
    82
    00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,240
    On average, medical advances and better living conditions
    
    83
    00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,080
    are enabling us to get older and older.
    
    84
    00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,600
    But can we extend our lifespan indefinitely?
    
    85
    00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:37,480
    And would we really want to?
    
    86
    00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,680
    If you believe in evolution and.
    
    87
    00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,760
    Lots of people want to live forever
    
    88
    00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,640
    and they wonder if we can reverse or slow down the aging process in.
    
    89
    00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,800
    An unkind.
    
    90
    00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,680
    History tells us
    
    91
    00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,120
    so much about violence, death and dying,
    
    92
    00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,120
    but it also touches on reincarnation and life.
    
    93
    00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,960
    It's a hugely popular thing.
    
    94
    00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,360
    Immortality is a topic that will never die.
    
    95
    00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,600
    Is abolition
    
    96
    00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,000
    in Germany.
    
    97
    00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,560
    There's a famous painting, The Fountain of Youth.
    
    98
    00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,680
    And on the painting you see all the old men and women, particularly
    
    99
    00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,880
    taking their clothes off
    
    100
    00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,320
    and getting into the fountain of youth
    
    101
    00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,240
    and swimming across
    
    102
    00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,080
    to the other side and emerging young and healthy on the other side.
    
    103
    00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,800
    And then going off to the tents and dressing
    
    104
    00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,080
    and then having a wonderful dinner together with plenty of wine.
    
    105
    00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,800
    And it's it's man's age old dream
    
    106
    00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,360
    to be able to reverse aging.
    
    107
    00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:41,800
    He says
    
    108
    00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,440
    this fountain of youth has become an allegory in biomedical research.
    
    109
    00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,320
    It's no longer
    
    110
    00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,400
    just about eating a healthy diet and leading a balanced lifestyle.
    
    111
    00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,360
    We want to make more serious adjustments and we can take pills
    
    112
    00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,680
    or get injections and so on, and we'll end up living longer.
    
    113
    00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,200
    The idea of the fountain of youth that's outside me
    
    114
    00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,680
    that I can jump into is shifted to a fountain that's put inside me,
    
    115
    00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,240
    injected into me.
    
    116
    00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,800
    And it's an opposite.
    
    117
    00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,080
    We are closer to finding the fountain of youth than ever before.
    
    118
    00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,200
    But what if aging were kind of program?
    
    119
    00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,280
    A program we could hack into
    
    120
    00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,320
    an initial clue
    
    121
    00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,160
    as to how humans might be reprogramed.
    
    122
    00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,680
    Leads to an unassuming setting in Central America.
    
    123
    00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,400
    And
    
    124
    00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,600
    I've lived in Costa Rica since 1972
    
    125
    00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,240
    and just completely fell in love
    
    126
    00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,360
    with Costa Rica.
    
    127
    00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,480
    The peninsula
    
    128
    00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,680
    of Nicoya is a place where people age
    
    129
    00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,560
    very well and long.
    
    130
    00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,600
    I think about it all the time.
    
    131
    00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,360
    I think about it all the time because it's really mysterious and
    
    132
    00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,280
    they themselves can not give you any clues as to why you ask them.
    
    133
    00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,680
    And they say, I have no idea.
    
    134
    00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,000
    It just is what it is.
    
    135
    00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,120
    But yet we are more curious and we want to know more.
    
    136
    00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,480
    Ana Gayle Glen
    
    137
    00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,400
    takes care of some of the region's centenarians.
    
    138
    00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,680
    The residents of Costa Rica's Nicoya Peninsula
    
    139
    00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,800
    not only live longer but stay healthy for
    
    140
    00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,280
    longer to.
    
    141
    00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,880
    So much time.
    
    142
    00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:51,760
    Huh?
    
    143
    00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:57,480
    I'm leaving Guatemala and daniel nati.
    
    144
    00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,040
    Socorro is 91.
    
    145
    00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,640
    People here often live to be over 90,
    
    146
    00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,800
    many to over 100.
    
    147
    00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,360
    What is in your state?
    
    148
    00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,600
    These are herbs you use to heal diseases associated.
    
    149
    00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,600
    That's right.
    
    150
    00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,760
    What's your health?
    
    151
    00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,280
    Lots of people around the world
    
    152
    00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,640
    want to know how to live a long and healthy life.
    
    153
    00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,360
    What's your advice?
    
    154
    00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,280
    They're not going to have a controlled
    
    155
    00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,560
    live for many years.
    
    156
    00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,920
    Go mad, scramble, eat a healthy diet
    
    157
    00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,440
    and lead a peaceful, stress free life.
    
    158
    00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,160
    Why eggs?
    
    159
    00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,240
    Oh, lots of vitamins.
    
    160
    00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,320
    Uh huh.
    
    161
    00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,760
    Guess she's napping.
    
    162
    00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,640
    When a person eats lots of cheese, their heart won't suffer.
    
    163
    00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,680
    Mhm.
    
    164
    00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,600
    No, it's as though
    
    165
    00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,080
    this area
    
    166
    00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,120
    was very, very distantly removed from the mainland, so to speak.
    
    167
    00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,960
    It's a peninsula.
    
    168
    00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,920
    It's still connected.
    
    169
    00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,480
    But our roads were bad.
    
    170
    00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,520
    Communication didn't exist.
    
    171
    00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,320
    People survived
    
    172
    00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,920
    here on what they planted,
    
    173
    00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,520
    on what their parents taught them, how to survive.
    
    174
    00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,920
    There was no pharmacy to go to
    
    175
    00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,440
    that smells so good or lack of wine.
    
    176
    00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,920
    This herb treats fever and all kinds of things.
    
    177
    00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,200
    My opinion.
    
    178
    00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,840
    The fact that people in Nicoya live to be older than average
    
    179
    00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,920
    went largely unnoticed
    
    180
    00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,840
    until one scientist stumbled onto some unusual data
    
    181
    00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:41,000
    some years ago.
    
    182
    00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,960
    Before my second professional initiative.
    
    183
    00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,520
    I was initially an economist,
    
    184
    00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,840
    but it never really felt like the right field for me.
    
    185
    00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,880
    Eventually, I found my knees and demographics.
    
    186
    00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,160
    It's much more precise with clear cut rules.
    
    187
    00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,200
    It's black and. White and they or
    
    188
    00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,920
    they manage the got swallowed.
    
    189
    00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,000
    By sheer coincidence, we discovered that mortality rates in the region
    
    190
    00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,080
    were much lower than the rest of the country.
    
    191
    00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,280
    You know already much importance here.
    
    192
    00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,720
    Initially, I didn't pay much attention to it.
    
    193
    00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,400
    Well, my paper I.
    
    194
    00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,680
    When I presented my findings at a conference,
    
    195
    00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,080
    there was a lot of skepticism about whether it was really so.
    
    196
    00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,840
    In Costa Rica, fragmented, less costly.
    
    197
    00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,120
    And I think they don't want that.
    
    198
    00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,480
    Person, but one person from the audience approached me afterwards
    
    199
    00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,200
    and said it's because it's a blue zone.
    
    200
    00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,320
    In some way.
    
    201
    00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,840
    And at that moment, I realized that Nicoya really was a special place.
    
    202
    00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,200
    You know, local career.
    
    203
    00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,240
    Nicoya
    
    204
    00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,120
    Five so-called
    
    205
    00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,800
    blue zones have been identified so far on our planet.
    
    206
    00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,120
    These are locations where an unusually
    
    207
    00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,560
    high percentage of the population lives very long.
    
    208
    00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,160
    Men in
    
    209
    00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,600
    Nicoya have the world's highest life expectancy.
    
    210
    00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,920
    An 80 year old male
    
    211
    00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,680
    here is likely to outlive his contemporaries elsewhere
    
    212
    00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,440
    by an average 8.2 years.
    
    213
    00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,560
    We're going off.
    
    214
    00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,600
    But why
    
    215
    00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,360
    is it the diet rich in fruit in Nicoya?
    
    216
    00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,920
    Or does religious faith explain it fairly?
    
    217
    00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,880
    There wasn't any real data.
    
    218
    00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,480
    That said that. The real mantra of Yeah.
    
    219
    00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,120
    That's what I'm almost product guy.
    
    220
    00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,800
    The question is, is it genetics or is it lifestyle
    
    221
    00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,880
    being?
    
    222
    00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,560
    People in Costa Rica say probably the good I me, the.
    
    223
    00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,160
    And think I used to joke most of it.
    
    224
    00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,120
    We carried out a study to see what happens when people leave Nicoya
    
    225
    00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,320
    and what happens when people from other parts of the country
    
    226
    00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,480
    move to Nicoya.
    
    227
    00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,920
    Parties in price of evicting Nicoya
    
    228
    00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,280
    we must get.
    
    229
    00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,680
    We found out that neither of these groups achieved the same longevity
    
    230
    00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,920
    as those who are born and spend their whole lives here.
    
    231
    00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,000
    Even on three, ten, 20.
    
    232
    00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,320
    In blue zones, eating seems to proceed more slowly.
    
    233
    00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,440
    Than people come from.
    
    234
    00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,920
    The environment and the lifestyle appear
    
    235
    00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,720
    to positively impact human biology.
    
    236
    00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,280
    For me.
    
    237
    00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,480
    But how exactly and will this help us
    
    238
    00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:55,320
    crack the aging code?
    
    239
    00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,480
    I'm molecular biologist, biochemist.
    
    240
    00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,760
    I'm interested in understanding the origin of diseases.
    
    241
    00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,480
    The majority of diseases are those associated with the aging process.
    
    242
    00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,920
    So I'm interested in understanding why we age the molecular level.
    
    243
    00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,440
    I wanted to devote my life
    
    244
    00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,880
    to understand the origins of cancer on aging.
    
    245
    00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,880
    I thought telomerase could be the key.
    
    246
    00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,320
    The human body consists of around 37 trillion
    
    247
    00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,280
    cells, some last a few days.
    
    248
    00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,240
    Others live for years.
    
    249
    00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,920
    We constantly produce new cells to replace the old ones.
    
    250
    00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:40,320
    It's a process that involves duplication.
    
    251
    00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,640
    Before cell division can take place, the chromosomes
    
    252
    00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,280
    in the cell nucleus have to be duplicated.
    
    253
    00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,320
    The DNA double helix
    
    254
    00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,760
    they consist of is unwound and separated into strands.
    
    255
    00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,760
    Each strand then becomes a template for a new one.
    
    256
    00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,800
    The ends of the chromosomes,
    
    257
    00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,520
    which are especially prone to replication errors,
    
    258
    00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:07,760
    are protected by telomeres, which are sequences of non-coding DNA.
    
    259
    00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,080
    But with every cell division, these safety caps
    
    260
    00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,080
    become shorter
    
    261
    00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,200
    and.
    
    262
    00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:22,960
    Less
    
    263
    00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,080
    charged.
    
    264
    00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,880
    I feel charged
    
    265
    00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,800
    with that.
    
    266
    00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,280
    The issue
    
    267
    00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:45,040
    of the telomeres.
    
    268
    00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,280
    Imagine this shoelace is our chromosome.
    
    269
    00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,920
    So this part of the shoelace is the DNA
    
    270
    00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,280
    where the genetic information is.
    
    271
    00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,280
    And this little plastic part,
    
    272
    00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,560
    which is very important to protect the shoelace would be the telomere.
    
    273
    00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,640
    So the telomeres are very important to protect our chromosomes,
    
    274
    00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,920
    to protect the DNA.
    
    275
    00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,440
    As we age, the telomeres become shorter and shorter.
    
    276
    00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,880
    This is because every time that we have a damage,
    
    277
    00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,320
    the cells have to multiply to regenerate the damage.
    
    278
    00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,880
    And this shortens the delivers
    
    279
    00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,000
    to the cell division of the cell multiplication.
    
    280
    00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,560
    So at the end,
    
    281
    00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,840
    the telomeres become so short that we don't have any more active them.
    
    282
    00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,800
    So now our DNA is unprotected and this is leading to
    
    283
    00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,880
    aging, is leading to disease, and ultimately will be leading to this
    
    284
    00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,480
    cell division.
    
    285
    00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,160
    And the rate of telomere shortening may be influenced by our lifestyle,
    
    286
    00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,000
    smoking, stress, environmental pollutants
    
    287
    00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,320
    and poor nutrition are all negative factors.
    
    288
    00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,080
    Some researchers believe living in harmony with the natural world
    
    289
    00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:54,120
    has a positive effect.
    
    290
    00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,760
    You know, Sartre's sucking.
    
    291
    00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,480
    We couldn't carry out experiments like this in Costa Rica,
    
    292
    00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,520
    so we sent our samples away.
    
    293
    00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,680
    When the results of this collaboration came back,
    
    294
    00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,160
    we realized we'd found something.
    
    295
    00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,440
    Lost in a similar anarchy.
    
    296
    00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:07,840
    Okay.
    
    297
    00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,040
    And then contra las personas. Nicole.
    
    298
    00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,800
    Kaya, DNA.
    
    299
    00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,280
    People from Nicoya have longer telomeres,
    
    300
    00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,360
    significantly longer telomeres than people in the rest of the country.
    
    301
    00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,400
    This tiny piece.
    
    302
    00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,200
    Scientists like Maria Blasco
    
    303
    00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,880
    are exploring ways of artificially lengthening telomeres
    
    304
    00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,280
    in order to slow the aging process.
    
    305
    00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,440
    But this does come at a risk.
    
    306
    00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,120
    To your father by is does.
    
    307
    00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,960
    The danger is that cancer can develop because cancer
    
    308
    00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,720
    cells are immortal and we're walking a fine line here.
    
    309
    00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,720
    Do we tell the cells to resist their preprogramed cell death and risk
    
    310
    00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,520
    that it will result in cancer?
    
    311
    00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,840
    Or do we leave things to run their natural course
    
    312
    00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,040
    and let the cells die when their time is up
    
    313
    00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,800
    and there's no proliferation?
    
    314
    00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,720
    And we just accept
    
    315
    00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:00,360
    that our final destination is around 120 to 125 years.
    
    316
    00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,400
    Of unsuccessful, not from one scientist.
    
    317
    00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,560
    But of course we all know the answer.
    
    318
    00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,880
    Humans want to test the boundaries
    
    319
    00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,840
    and see if they can really live to 150
    
    320
    00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,000
    or 300 and.
    
    321
    00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,640
    How far can we go?
    
    322
    00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,120
    How much should science interfere
    
    323
    00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:30,280
    in nature's blueprint?
    
    324
    00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,560
    We don't have to necessarily accept current
    
    325
    00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,720
    biological limitations because that's what we do as a species.
    
    326
    00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,400
    We're problem solvers.
    
    327
    00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,120
    We don't just sit around and get rained on, we build houses.
    
    328
    00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:46,560
    So we may want to transcend normal biology at some point
    
    329
    00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,440
    and set goals for ourself beyond just normal concepts
    
    330
    00:18:50,440 --> 00:19:03,960
    of health.
    
    331
    00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,320
    When you wonder about what is aging, you end up asking
    
    332
    00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,440
    how tissues repair.
    
    333
    00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:16,400
    This is a process that is still poorly understood.
    
    334
    00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,600
    Cells progressively accumulate damage they age,
    
    335
    00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:28,080
    but when they reach a certain threshold, they undergo a switch.
    
    336
    00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,680
    They become senescent.
    
    337
    00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:31,840
    I like to describe
    
    338
    00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,040
    them as zombies because, you know,
    
    339
    00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,600
    they're like in a middle stage between alive and dead.
    
    340
    00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,200
    They're not either, but they're at the same time
    
    341
    00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,080
    they're really damaging.
    
    342
    00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,560
    Senescent
    
    343
    00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,240
    cells produce an alarm signal
    
    344
    00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,280
    so that the other cells in the body
    
    345
    00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,320
    realize that there is a damage there and they go and they repair.
    
    346
    00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,440
    The problem is that as we get older, these
    
    347
    00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,160
    repair says they are also old and they don't go and they don't repair.
    
    348
    00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,960
    And we accumulate these cells that are constantly producing this alarm.
    
    349
    00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,440
    This is a phenomenon that is called inflammation.
    
    350
    00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,600
    All people have inflammatory signals
    
    351
    00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:16,040
    elevated caused by their own senescent cells
    
    352
    00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:22,440
    that are not eliminated.
    
    353
    00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,000
    We are trying to crack the code of these senescent
    
    354
    00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,240
    cells, trying to understand their vulnerabilities, how to kill them
    
    355
    00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,800
    without killing the non senescent cells.
    
    356
    00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,040
    In some initial experiments, Manuel Serrano
    
    357
    00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,720
    and his team were able to show that mice lived longer.
    
    358
    00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,960
    Once they're senescent or zombie cells were eliminated.
    
    359
    00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,600
    But that does not guarantee eternal youth.
    
    360
    00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,600
    It's a double edged sword.
    
    361
    00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,520
    Senescent cells play also very good,
    
    362
    00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,280
    an important role, for example, in wound healing.
    
    363
    00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,720
    If you have a wound,
    
    364
    00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,240
    if you don't have senescence, the wound will never hear.
    
    365
    00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,720
    So you could have a treatment that removes all senescent cells
    
    366
    00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,160
    and suddenly you have terrible side effects.
    
    367
    00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,280
    It just means we need more research, you know.
    
    368
    00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,680
    Research into telomeres and zombie cells are only
    
    369
    00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,240
    two approaches in the race for longevity.
    
    370
    00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,080
    And one thing is certain whoever cracks the code
    
    371
    00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:33,440
    is set to earn millions.
    
    372
    00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,760
    All right,
    
    373
    00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,760
    so, guys, how do I look?
    
    374
    00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:45,440
    Do I look old?
    
    375
    00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,680
    So you've seen what we did.
    
    376
    00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,760
    We've announced that $255 million raise
    
    377
    00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,360
    is the largest raise in our industry
    
    378
    00:21:54,360 --> 00:22:04,680
    to date.
    
    379
    00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:08,280
    Hong Kong has the highest life expectancy on the planet today,
    
    380
    00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,760
    which is no surprise because longevity is very often
    
    381
    00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,960
    correlate it with wealth.
    
    382
    00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,320
    And here people are filthy rich.
    
    383
    00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,960
    Welfare is
    
    384
    00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,520
    increasing dramatically in the region, in China, in mainland
    
    385
    00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,680
    people who were peasants just 35 years ago,
    
    386
    00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,760
    they are now multimillionaires.
    
    387
    00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:39,480
    And people demand longevity.
    
    388
    00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,360
    As a CEO of a biotech company,
    
    389
    00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,040
    I tried to collaborate with a lot of people and I tried to contribute
    
    390
    00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:52,040
    as many projects as possible.
    
    391
    00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:56,840
    Life Clinic is a very fun concept where the founder is decided
    
    392
    00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,880
    to bridge the Starbucks concept
    
    393
    00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,280
    with preventative medical care.
    
    394
    00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,000
    You choose a cocktail of all kinds of nutrients
    
    395
    00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,200
    that will be going into your blood
    
    396
    00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,240
    while you are sipping on a juice.
    
    397
    00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,920
    They offer IV drips and all kinds of other interventions.
    
    398
    00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,280
    I cannot vouch for some of them, man.
    
    399
    00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,520
    Yeah, I. Be. Correct.
    
    400
    00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,360
    Correct.
    
    401
    00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,720
    In Hong Kong? Correct.
    
    402
    00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,640
    Anything geared at increasing life expectancy
    
    403
    00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,400
    already promises megabucks, dubious wonder.
    
    404
    00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,240
    Drugs and IV drips are readily available.
    
    405
    00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,040
    The region
    
    406
    00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,560
    is also attracting biotech companies from around the world.
    
    407
    00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,760
    Money from wealthy investors
    
    408
    00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:53,200
    has created a much hyped start up scene longevity research is Hong
    
    409
    00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:59,040
    Kong's new dotcom boom.
    
    410
    00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,640
    And.
    
    411
    00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,200
    A new development is that the research is being carried out
    
    412
    00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,960
    with business startup methods, with massive capital.
    
    413
    00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,040
    We're investing or pumping funds into it, we're throwing cash at it,
    
    414
    00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,800
    and that will invariably result in a product.
    
    415
    00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,800
    It's an infallible economic model.
    
    416
    00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,200
    It will always work. To.
    
    417
    00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,920
    Reach a market.
    
    418
    00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,440
    There's a huge market for these new companies.
    
    419
    00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,160
    One really is to have treatments for for diseases.
    
    420
    00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,400
    So that's where the
    
    421
    00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:32,680
    big bucks are.
    
    422
    00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,680
    I'm willing to experiment on myself
    
    423
    00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,960
    because there is a lot of data on me.
    
    424
    00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,080
    I'm one of the most well studied humans on the planet now,
    
    425
    00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,120
    and I try
    
    426
    00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,080
    to optimize for high performance at this point in time.
    
    427
    00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,360
    I try to perform at my peak.
    
    428
    00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,320
    I've tried rapamycin in the past.
    
    429
    00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:56,560
    It's very often referred to as a magic drug in longevity,
    
    430
    00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,080
    in not in the same line as metformin,
    
    431
    00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,800
    but it's likely to be stronger than the form
    
    432
    00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,720
    and it's not without side effects.
    
    433
    00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,600
    So there is a chance that you are going to see Mucositis
    
    434
    00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,960
    and a few others.
    
    435
    00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,360
    So we decided to try it on ourself
    
    436
    00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,640
    in a very controlled mode.
    
    437
    00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,680
    Any side effects?
    
    438
    00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,080
    Not at all. Zero side effects.
    
    439
    00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,040
    When I was exercising in the hotel,
    
    440
    00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,800
    I got some serious muscle mass increases here.
    
    441
    00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,600
    It's great.
    
    442
    00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,800
    I actually, as a cook.
    
    443
    00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,920
    All right.
    
    444
    00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,520
    Yeah, that's me.
    
    445
    00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,600
    So that's for the rest of
    
    446
    00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,040
    this.
    
    447
    00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,520
    Oh, thank you. This.
    
    448
    00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,000
    Thank you so much for coming here.
    
    449
    00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,520
    Yes. Your whole life literally.
    
    450
    00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,840
    To a life.
    
    451
    00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:59,520
    Rapamycin, metformin, energy boosters.
    
    452
    00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,600
    Do any of these substances really help?
    
    453
    00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:23,160
    How can their effectiveness be tested?
    
    454
    00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:27,080
    I was interested in anti-aging signs since I was a teenager
    
    455
    00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,560
    growing up in Frankfurt, Germany.
    
    456
    00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:35,000
    I had a group of friends who were very interested in science,
    
    457
    00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,000
    and at some point we realized the most important
    
    458
    00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
    challenge of our generation is to prolong life.
    
    459
    00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,480
    We had very lofty goals.
    
    460
    00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,360
    I need to tell you, you know, we have crazy goals.
    
    461
    00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:53,640
    We wanted to study physics, math, biology, chemistry.
    
    462
    00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,920
    Also, we wanted to do space travel.
    
    463
    00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,520
    And then
    
    464
    00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,200
    the minute you think of space travel, you realize that you will need
    
    465
    00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,360
    decades, you know, to travel for centuries.
    
    466
    00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,520
    And so we felt we really need to solve this problem first
    
    467
    00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:15,080
    to extend our lifespan before we can even think about space travel
    
    468
    00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,200
    one day by accident.
    
    469
    00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,040
    Really, because I did somebody a favor.
    
    470
    00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,160
    I analyze this methylation data.
    
    471
    00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,360
    I immediately recognized that epigenetics
    
    472
    00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,120
    or methylation is really the data source
    
    473
    00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,800
    that has a tremendous signal for aging.
    
    474
    00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,560
    He was able to find clusters of genes
    
    475
    00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,040
    whose methylation state could tell you
    
    476
    00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,240
    how old you were at a particular time.
    
    477
    00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,240
    The amazing thing about this is that it works
    
    478
    00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,840
    from the day you're created as a fertilized egg cell
    
    479
    00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:56,080
    all the way until the day that you die.
    
    480
    00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,160
    There are more than 200 distinct cell types in the human body,
    
    481
    00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,480
    although they all contain the same DNA.
    
    482
    00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,800
    There is a mechanism
    
    483
    00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,760
    that tells the cell whether it is a skin cell or a liver cell.
    
    484
    00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:14,320
    For example, called epigenetics.
    
    485
    00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,920
    This involves information that sits on the DNA
    
    486
    00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:25,040
    resulting in genes being switched on or off.
    
    487
    00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:29,200
    Perhaps the best known type of epigenetic change is methylation,
    
    488
    00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,320
    the addition or removal of methyl groups
    
    489
    00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,640
    on the DNA strand.
    
    490
    00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:41,600
    These changes continue to take place throughout our lives.
    
    491
    00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,600
    The DNA contains four letters.
    
    492
    00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:48,720
    A CTG methylation sometimes attaches to the letter
    
    493
    00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,520
    C and modifies it similar to an omelet
    
    494
    00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,200
    by keeping track very carefully
    
    495
    00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,840
    which parts of the DNA gain, methylation
    
    496
    00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,720
    or lose methylation we can measure aging
    
    497
    00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:07,560
    methylation can be sort of like the rust that accumulates.
    
    498
    00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,040
    By measuring the amount of rust, we can determine age.
    
    499
    00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,800
    So if we have an hourglass, the passage of time is measured
    
    500
    00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:21,280
    by how the sand how much sand accumulates at the bottom.
    
    501
    00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:25,040
    The DNA molecule, though, has 28 million
    
    502
    00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,880
    different hourglass because we have 28 million.
    
    503
    00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,440
    Let us see in our DNA.
    
    504
    00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,280
    So by averaging the measurements of 28 million hour
    
    505
    00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:42,160
    glasses, you arrive at a very accurate measure of age.
    
    506
    00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,720
    This is one of the most
    
    507
    00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:47,320
    insightful discoveries in the history of mankind.
    
    508
    00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,200
    Does we like the invention of the wheel?
    
    509
    00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,040
    What is.
    
    510
    00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,200
    That? Definitely as a turning point in aging?
    
    511
    00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,760
    I think that was just a very,
    
    512
    00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:59,000
    very important point where we realized, hey, we can measure aging now.
    
    513
    00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,280
    The epigenetic clock has revolutionized research into aging
    
    514
    00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,680
    with a simple DNA sample.
    
    515
    00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,920
    Anyone's biologic age can be determined,
    
    516
    00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,080
    however, that can produce
    
    517
    00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:20,920
    some nasty surprises.
    
    518
    00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,960
    My name is Marcus Horvath, and I am Steve's
    
    519
    00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,520
    identical twin brother
    
    520
    00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,040
    is my older twin.
    
    521
    00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,320
    Brother is 5 minutes older than me,
    
    522
    00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,880
    however, only at birth.
    
    523
    00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,880
    We measured our epigenetic clock a couple of years ago,
    
    524
    00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,440
    and then according to one of the clocks,
    
    525
    00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,520
    I was actually four years older than him,
    
    526
    00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:56,800
    which is not necessarily good news.
    
    527
    00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:01,840
    Those technologies are enabling us to accelerate
    
    528
    00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,360
    aging research dramatically by not waiting until you die.
    
    529
    00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,400
    We can now measure where you.
    
    530
    00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,880
    Are in life.
    
    531
    00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,240
    And measure how different interventions affect
    
    532
    00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,680
    that prediction.
    
    533
    00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:20,560
    We picked this up and applied a to the same problem
    
    534
    00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,920
    and developed many, many Asian clocks.
    
    535
    00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,240
    Above all, the quest
    
    536
    00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,800
    for eternal life requires personal biological data.
    
    537
    00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,600
    The digital devices we use every day can provide mountains of it.
    
    538
    00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,800
    Big data is currently one of the most promising
    
    539
    00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,240
    approaches to cracking the aging code.
    
    540
    00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,960
    Unlike conventional medicine
    
    541
    00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,720
    or artificial intelligence can scour the data for hidden patterns
    
    542
    00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,480
    to help prevent diseases from developing in the first place.
    
    543
    00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,040
    This situation looks very
    
    544
    00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,480
    similar to fast on the subway.
    
    545
    00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,800
    So when you pull your wallet and you don't know who,
    
    546
    00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:03,080
    every human on the train looks the same.
    
    547
    00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:03,840
    They move.
    
    548
    00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:11,280
    They move in different patterns.
    
    549
    00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:15,440
    So you need to observe many, many of those scenarios
    
    550
    00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:19,520
    in many subways globally to develop
    
    551
    00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:23,240
    a really precise algorithm for catching a thief on the subway.
    
    552
    00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,800
    And you train AI technologies to recognize those thieves
    
    553
    00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,120
    and predict human behavior.
    
    554
    00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:35,320
    And I think nowadays in advanced countries like mainland China,
    
    555
    00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,200
    there are video monitoring techniques that allow you automatically
    
    556
    00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,880
    to recognize the fast
    
    557
    00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,160
    movement.
    
    558
    00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,360
    So it's very similar to recognize
    
    559
    00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,680
    those proteins that misbehave during aging
    
    560
    00:32:50,840 --> 00:33:01,320
    and cause trouble.
    
    561
    00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:01,560
    Yeah.
    
    562
    00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:05,480
    So what we are going to do now, we're going to solve a disease
    
    563
    00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,600
    very quickly.
    
    564
    00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,120
    We're going to solve the Crohn's disease.
    
    565
    00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,840
    A.I.
    
    566
    00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,200
    is already poised to increase our life expectancy,
    
    567
    00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,120
    or so
    
    568
    00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:21,800
    we're told, at the touch of a button.
    
    569
    00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,600
    Start ups can run through thousands of possible outcomes and quickly
    
    570
    00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:32,040
    discover new medications,
    
    571
    00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:36,160
    all based on data from users of apps like the one that Alex
    
    572
    00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:40,400
    Zhavoronkov has developed.
    
    573
    00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:44,000
    We recently received $255 million
    
    574
    00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,040
    from a group of ultra elite investors.
    
    575
    00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,200
    So it turned out that we are in the right place,
    
    576
    00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,040
    in the right time, with the right technology.
    
    577
    00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:57,080
    I think that very soon we will see guys like Amazon.
    
    578
    00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:01,560
    I'm waiting for those guys to react, guys like Facebook,
    
    579
    00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,960
    guys that produce video games, Netflix,
    
    580
    00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,560
    those people who steal your time,
    
    581
    00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,040
    they will come back and try to figure out how to make more time
    
    582
    00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:21,000
    so you can wasted on their product.
    
    583
    00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,640
    Silicon Valley is already on board.
    
    584
    00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:29,400
    In 2013, Google founded a secretive biotech venture called Calico.
    
    585
    00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,680
    Its longevity research is carried out behind
    
    586
    00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,960
    closed doors with nearly unlimited resources.
    
    587
    00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,080
    A group backed by Amazon founder Jeff
    
    588
    00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:42,600
    Bezos has also burst onto the anti-aging scene
    
    589
    00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:46,680
    with hundreds of millions in funding Altos Labs
    
    590
    00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:50,840
    is recruiting top scientists from around the globe to join the project.
    
    591
    00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,360
    They include Steve Horvath and Manuel Serrano.
    
    592
    00:34:54,920 --> 00:35:02,920
    There's even a longevity clinic in the pipeline.
    
    593
    00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,960
    Despite the big players jockeying for position,
    
    594
    00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,960
    there are still opportunities for smaller projects
    
    595
    00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,480
    like Startup Bio Biotin,
    
    596
    00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,400
    which is working flat out to develop a self-test
    
    597
    00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,360
    to measure aging.
    
    598
    00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,440
    Biotin is a group of people who are working towards the goal
    
    599
    00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:27,760
    of extending healthspan and eradicating aging with its users.
    
    600
    00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,960
    We're all just sort of a group of people with a sort of a fascination
    
    601
    00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,760
    for age related diseases and aging itself.
    
    602
    00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:37,800
    We have sort of focused on this idea of biological age itself.
    
    603
    00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,400
    We tell you what your biological age is in sort of an accessible
    
    604
    00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,120
    and cheap manner.
    
    605
    00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:43,800
    And a lot
    
    606
    00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,800
    of biological age tests currently are very pricey, which is fine.
    
    607
    00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,960
    I mean, it makes total sense,
    
    608
    00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,360
    especially for Biohackers
    
    609
    00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,840
    and people who are way more interested in the very deep signs of aging.
    
    610
    00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,800
    But we just want to give
    
    611
    00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,360
    and general encapsulation of your aging process
    
    612
    00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,440
    to the general population.
    
    613
    00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,800
    Nina's clock is designed to determine
    
    614
    00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,320
    age based on proteins in saliva,
    
    615
    00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,520
    although she can only work in a lab once she turns 16,
    
    616
    00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,640
    she's found ways to access the latest data.
    
    617
    00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,640
    Go to research paper website
    
    618
    00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,600
    and they are supplementary files
    
    619
    00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,640
    that we were able to download and see their data.
    
    620
    00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,600
    So that's really cool.
    
    621
    00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,120
    Sometimes when it comes to us working directly with labs,
    
    622
    00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,800
    they send us the data personally.
    
    623
    00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,680
    They tell us Here is the work we've done because it often helps them to
    
    624
    00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:32,280
    in their projects.
    
    625
    00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,640
    You know, people like Nina
    
    626
    00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:37,160
    are taking advantage of a new paradigm, really,
    
    627
    00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,320
    in which you can the data on your own data is available.
    
    628
    00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,840
    My lab does that.
    
    629
    00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:46,320
    On the one hand, I download data, but I also upload a lot of data.
    
    630
    00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,160
    I put millions of dollars worth of data into the public domain.
    
    631
    00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,600
    I think it's cool. Yeah,
    
    632
    00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,400
    I think it's very cool.
    
    633
    00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,760
    Actually.
    
    634
    00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,040
    I know you're making some progress on the image of the test recently
    
    635
    00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,600
    and kind of have a good rendering.
    
    636
    00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,040
    And did you want to show your screen
    
    637
    00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,520
    and show what that might look like?
    
    638
    00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,360
    Yeah, I'll just do that right now.
    
    639
    00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,240
    Hold on.
    
    640
    00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,640
    Basically right now,
    
    641
    00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,920
    I think what we decided was
    
    642
    00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,600
    the best way is like having a multi panel test
    
    643
    00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,000
    with each corresponding to one protein.
    
    644
    00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,240
    We're using the same technology used in pregnancy tests.
    
    645
    00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,400
    So I think that's pretty interesting.
    
    646
    00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,800
    He's spent on the test in the sample area.
    
    647
    00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,360
    Then from there,
    
    648
    00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:26,720
    you downloaded sort of our app and from there you're able to find out,
    
    649
    00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:31,560
    you know, the ratios of your control to sort of your protein line.
    
    650
    00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,840
    So what is the
    
    651
    00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:36,600
    concentration of these proteins and based on the color of this test,
    
    652
    00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,440
    so you you scan this, you find out that information
    
    653
    00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,440
    you entered into our website and you can find out more
    
    654
    00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,360
    about your aging process.
    
    655
    00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,120
    We want to do a subscription based
    
    656
    00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,000
    you know, you're going to get several tests a year
    
    657
    00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,640
    because, you know,
    
    658
    00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,520
    it's slowly going to get better, as, you know, as you improve too.
    
    659
    00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:56,760
    So it'll be really cool.
    
    660
    00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:00,440
    It would be very hard to conceive even
    
    661
    00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,280
    wanting to do that for me,
    
    662
    00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,920
    and I don't think anybody here is going to sign up
    
    663
    00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,040
    for it.
    
    664
    00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,000
    In contrast to Nina,
    
    665
    00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,560
    Ana, Gail Glen in Costa Rica has already ended her professional life.
    
    666
    00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:25,320
    A successful swimwear designer, she was able to retire at age 50.
    
    667
    00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,760
    Ever since, she's been involved in a range
    
    668
    00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,880
    of social projects.
    
    669
    00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,320
    It's about being unified.
    
    670
    00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,200
    It's about to participate and be of service.
    
    671
    00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,040
    You know, do what you can care for yourself,
    
    672
    00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,160
    but do what you can to care for others as well.
    
    673
    00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:47,240
    And hopefully you get to a point in life where your basic needs
    
    674
    00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,440
    are being met well enough
    
    675
    00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,320
    that you have plenty of time to care for others.
    
    676
    00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,400
    It boils down to the question,
    
    677
    00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,960
    you know, do I do I save myself or do I save my community?
    
    678
    00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,960
    And really, if your community doesn't survive, what kind of life
    
    679
    00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,520
    are you going to have?
    
    680
    00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,840
    A couple of years ago, a law was passed
    
    681
    00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,360
    to protect the longhairs
    
    682
    00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,800
    or the centenarians of the area that we live in, which is considered
    
    683
    00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:18,440
    a legal blue zone, legal, you know, by law in Costa Rica.
    
    684
    00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:24,640
    So that's new.
    
    685
    00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,800
    Nicoya is preparing for an increasing number of centenarians.
    
    686
    00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,880
    A private initiative aims raise
    
    687
    00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,640
    funds to build the region's first nursing home.
    
    688
    00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,120
    Rapid advances in longevity research
    
    689
    00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,640
    are prompting a rethink of existing social structures.
    
    690
    00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,560
    What will our lives look like if we continue
    
    691
    00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:55,040
    to grow older and older?
    
    692
    00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,840
    The centenarians did their contribution.
    
    693
    00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,600
    Now it's somebody else's turn to take care of them.
    
    694
    00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,960
    One of them when a diet on.
    
    695
    00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,680
    Nicholas Weiner diet.
    
    696
    00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,680
    Literally glows when we visit.
    
    697
    00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,920
    The long heralds you ask them, How do you feel about this
    
    698
    00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,840
    project we're doing?
    
    699
    00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,640
    Well are completely.
    
    700
    00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,440
    I'm going to be 103 years go by.
    
    701
    00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,680
    That's great.
    
    702
    00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,640
    But when you get old, you eventually need some help.
    
    703
    00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:24,920
    You start.
    
    704
    00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,200
    Then you're lucky.
    
    705
    00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,920
    To live with your daughter who looks after you.
    
    706
    00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,440
    There are people who have no support or no.
    
    707
    00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,840
    Family is there for you. De la familia.
    
    708
    00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:34,560
    La familia.
    
    709
    00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,920
    No existing if you're in your mission to lives.
    
    710
    00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:38,600
    Yes.
    
    711
    00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,760
    I feel happy to have lived such a long life.
    
    712
    00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,040
    My friends and family are here.
    
    713
    00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,880
    I die.
    
    714
    00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:50,080
    I want to live as long as God wants me to hide that.
    
    715
    00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,000
    Can you see it?
    
    716
    00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,360
    Exact?
    
    717
    00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,040
    Not more.
    
    718
    00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:03,080
    I'm as time as evolved, being here
    
    719
    00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,120
    and observing the people who live in this blue zone,
    
    720
    00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,560
    I realize how connected they are.
    
    721
    00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,840
    The social component is very important.
    
    722
    00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,080
    They don't get cut off.
    
    723
    00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,280
    And limited and. A good.
    
    724
    00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,200
    And still today
    
    725
    00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,040
    we know that being part of a strong community is a life extending.
    
    726
    00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,160
    That's a way for anyone to grow older
    
    727
    00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,440
    without turning to pills and injections that alter our DNA.
    
    728
    00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:35,840
    Well, in my personal opinion, I would not waste time on blue zones.
    
    729
    00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,960
    We to fix the problem
    
    730
    00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,240
    of aging right here, right now.
    
    731
    00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,280
    We've reached a point of evolution
    
    732
    00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,160
    where we need to accelerate evolution ourself.
    
    733
    00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:51,240
    To do this, we need to evolve and we need to change as humans as well.
    
    734
    00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,720
    The the lack of any other
    
    735
    00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,560
    side.
    
    736
    00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,400
    That nature has no plan.
    
    737
    00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,440
    Nature is a random thing, right?
    
    738
    00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,400
    But it works.
    
    739
    00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,560
    Nature's built up
    
    740
    00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:10,200
    life on this planet over the last four and a half billion years.
    
    741
    00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:14,480
    And it is fine tuned and honed and optimized
    
    742
    00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:18,000
    thanks to an unbelievable able degree of perfection.
    
    743
    00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,000
    So you have to be a little bit careful about messing with Mother
    
    744
    00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:31,800
    Nature.
    
    745
    00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,280
    But.
    
    746
    00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,560
    One of the interesting things about super centenarians and centenarians
    
    747
    00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:44,400
    is that their immune systems last much better than the rest of us,
    
    748
    00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,680
    which is clue as to the fact that you need to have a good immune system
    
    749
    00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:52,320
    in order to stay alive a long time.
    
    750
    00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,480
    Steve Horvath is one of the scientists
    
    751
    00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:04,360
    set to follow the call of Amazon boss Jeff Bezos.
    
    752
    00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:08,200
    But before he embarks on that new task, he's
    
    753
    00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,640
    focusing on another promising project.
    
    754
    00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:15,680
    It's the so-called trim trial designed by his colleague
    
    755
    00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:19,200
    Greg Fahy to reverse immune system aging.
    
    756
    00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,280
    Hardly any other study in the field
    
    757
    00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,320
    has prompted as much interest in recent times.
    
    758
    00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,120
    The flow of immune cells plays a central role
    
    759
    00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,400
    in fighting illness in our bodies.
    
    760
    00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:36,440
    But there's a limited supply of these essential cells.
    
    761
    00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:40,000
    Our bodies, thymus gland, produces t cells,
    
    762
    00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:43,080
    the superstars of the adaptive immune system.
    
    763
    00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:47,760
    However, once we reach puberty, the thymus begins to shrink.
    
    764
    00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,880
    It is replaced by fatty tissue
    
    765
    00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,080
    and eventually stops producing new T cells.
    
    766
    00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,440
    Once we've used them up, our bodies become more susceptible
    
    767
    00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,600
    to pathogens and to age related diseases like cancer,
    
    768
    00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,760
    stroke and dementia.
    
    769
    00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,960
    When I saw that you could use
    
    770
    00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:14,640
    growth hormone to regrow the thymus and take immune system function
    
    771
    00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:19,200
    that was down to about 20% of the young immune system function
    
    772
    00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,720
    all the way back up to 100% of youthful function.
    
    773
    00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,640
    I just thought we have to do something about this.
    
    774
    00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,200
    But nobody took any action.
    
    775
    00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:32,440
    So I did an experiment on myself and I regrew my own thymus.
    
    776
    00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,320
    He published a scientific paper
    
    777
    00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:41,840
    that described one person and that was himself.
    
    778
    00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,840
    In 2016, the trial was repeated.
    
    779
    00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:51,360
    This time, a total of nine test subjects renewed their thymus.
    
    780
    00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,880
    They suspected the
    
    781
    00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:57,200
    treatment was having a positive effect on the whole body.
    
    782
    00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:01,040
    But how could he prove it?
    
    783
    00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,040
    This person came to me and said,
    
    784
    00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:07,320
    And you help me to analyze a treatment.
    
    785
    00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,160
    And the minute
    
    786
    00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,600
    he said the word thymus rejuvenation, I already said yes, you know.
    
    787
    00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:15,040
    Steve Horvath compared blood samples
    
    788
    00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,520
    from the test subjects before and after treatment.
    
    789
    00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,120
    And he was just as amazed,
    
    790
    00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:24,120
    if not more amazed as we were about the results.
    
    791
    00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,840
    If they are confirmed, it will be a sensation.
    
    792
    00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:32,960
    The original intention was get rid of the fat of the thymus.
    
    793
    00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,480
    This treatment had a side effect and unexpected side effect.
    
    794
    00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,520
    It really rejuvenated the methylation,
    
    795
    00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,640
    the epigenetic clock and.
    
    796
    00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,240
    All nine test subjects
    
    797
    00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:49,440
    turn their epigenetic clocks back by around 18 months and
    
    798
    00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,520
    a year of treatment.
    
    799
    00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,400
    That means they
    
    800
    00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,520
    had essentially reversed their biological age
    
    801
    00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:59,240
    by two and a half years.
    
    802
    00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:03,360
    We began to get reports from some of the people in the trial
    
    803
    00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,400
    that I feel great.
    
    804
    00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,600
    You know, I feel so energetic now.
    
    805
    00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:12,040
    I feel my mind is working faster than it's worked before.
    
    806
    00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:16,280
    Before this trial was over, this volunteer says, you know, my
    
    807
    00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:20,400
    my wife has been telling me that my hair's growing and dark again.
    
    808
    00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,240
    And I said, really?
    
    809
    00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,280
    That's interesting. Let's have a look.
    
    810
    00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:28,600
    So we looked at his hair and boy, it was a big, very strong difference.
    
    811
    00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:33,440
    His hair was darkening all over the place.
    
    812
    00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:39,120
    I need to say we are all very excited about it,
    
    813
    00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:42,720
    but we are also very sober scientists.
    
    814
    00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,920
    You know, and therefore, we always felt
    
    815
    00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,680
    we desperately need a second validation study.
    
    816
    00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,920
    And that's really why I continue to work
    
    817
    00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,120
    with Greg, why I become a study participant.
    
    818
    00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,080
    A third study with more test subjects
    
    819
    00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,000
    aims to corroborate the original results.
    
    820
    00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,800
    If successful, the famous regeneration
    
    821
    00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,600
    could be the first scientifically proven anti-aging treatment
    
    822
    00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,640
    for human beings.
    
    823
    00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,720
    But the scientists need more data.
    
    824
    00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:16,160
    Steve Horvath and his brother have volunteered
    
    825
    00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,640
    to take part in the trial as identical twins.
    
    826
    00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,320
    They are ideal candidates.
    
    827
    00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,680
    Steve will get the rejuvenation treatment
    
    828
    00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,600
    and Marcus will join the control group.
    
    829
    00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,840
    We're now ready for your baseline testing.
    
    830
    00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:35,680
    And this is the testing that you do before entering the term X trial.
    
    831
    00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,640
    And then we'll assess you after 12 months of treatment
    
    832
    00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:40,680
    and see how you fare. At that point.
    
    833
    00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:41,480
    The first step is.
    
    834
    00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:45,440
    A functional test where you're literally just standing up
    
    835
    00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:49,440
    and sitting back down as many times as you can within 30 seconds.
    
    836
    00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,640
    The outcome for me and.
    
    837
    00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:55,400
    The entire alliance, ever since we know that, no,
    
    838
    00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,360
    I had a better breakfast and.
    
    839
    00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:01,400
    Maybe after 12 months of the term treatment, you'll be able to compete
    
    840
    00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,520
    with that. All right.
    
    841
    00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:04,840
    And I'll give you a countdown.
    
    842
    00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,200
    Okay. On your mark.
    
    843
    00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,480
    Get set.
    
    844
    00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:16,640
    Go.
    
    845
    00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:20,000
    All right. That's it.
    
    846
    00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,360
    I feel it in my.
    
    847
    00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,920
    In my thigh.
    
    848
    00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,840
    Now that we have your blood pumping, we're going to be looking
    
    849
    00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:28,920
    at your epigenetic clock.
    
    850
    00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:32,880
    Okay.
    
    851
    00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:34,640
    And then
    
    852
    00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:46,800
    we're training.
    
    853
    00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,600
    80 women and men of different ages
    
    854
    00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:53,000
    are taking part in the latest thymus study.
    
    855
    00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:54,960
    And the treatment's inventor
    
    856
    00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,000
    also hopes to rejuvenate himself once again.
    
    857
    00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,560
    So I can't wait any longer.
    
    858
    00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:01,480
    I'm getting older.
    
    859
    00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,840
    I don't want to age. I'm 71.
    
    860
    00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,400
    I don't know how old I will be.
    
    861
    00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,080
    That's an open question.
    
    862
    00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,600
    I hope longer than usual,
    
    863
    00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:16,080
    and that's all I can say at this point.
    
    864
    00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:19,240
    The main component of the treatment is a growth hormone
    
    865
    00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,320
    to counteract certain side effects.
    
    866
    00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,880
    The steroid hormone, DHEA,
    
    867
    00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:28,240
    and the diabetes drug metformin are also added.
    
    868
    00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:29,560
    Down the
    
    869
    00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:35,400
    hatch.
    
    870
    00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,880
    I think about this future of biotechnology and
    
    871
    00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,600
    change in the composition of our bodies.
    
    872
    00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,720
    It worries me.
    
    873
    00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:49,880
    My dream is that there will be an intervention against aging
    
    874
    00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,560
    if we are lucky in five years and ten years.
    
    875
    00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:56,000
    And then people go to their annual checkup.
    
    876
    00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,880
    The doctor says, You know what, you're aging a little bit too fast.
    
    877
    00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:01,440
    Why don't you take this pill?
    
    878
    00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,320
    That's the dream.
    
    879
    00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,720
    So we are now building the toolkit,
    
    880
    00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,560
    many enabling technologies that need to converge.
    
    881
    00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:14,000
    And we need several more technologies to come to life
    
    882
    00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
    in order for us to make a major leap
    
    883
    00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,080
    in terms of longevity for everyone.
    
    884
    00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:22,920
    I think we are 25 years away.
    
    885
    00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:26,760
    The development of an anti-aging wonder drug
    
    886
    00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:27,880
    raises issues
    
    887
    00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:31,520
    that threaten the foundations of our natural and social order.
    
    888
    00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:35,880
    What will our planet look like if we live to be ever older?
    
    889
    00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:41,200
    Would overpopulation make our ecosystems and social systems collapse?
    
    890
    00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:47,280
    How can be in harmony with the natural world and human civilization?
    
    891
    00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:51,200
    Our lifestyle is expensive.
    
    892
    00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,280
    It consumes resources.
    
    893
    00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,400
    It creates overpopulation.
    
    894
    00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,720
    This is true.
    
    895
    00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,320
    I mean, we would live in very short life, didn't have such a value
    
    896
    00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:06,480
    and also not care so much for nature or for anything.
    
    897
    00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,640
    So maybe it's not bad that we live longer because then
    
    898
    00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:13,040
    we would care more about our planet and our environment
    
    899
    00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,400
    and the lives of the rest of the beings in
    
    900
    00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:34,920
    this planet.
