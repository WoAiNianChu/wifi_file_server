    no nerve pain either

    after the inoculation I clearly had
    
    63
    00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:01,200
    something five days later I had vision

    problems and dizziness and headaches I
    
    65
    00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,360
    went to the optician and was told I had
    
    66

    blockages behind both pupils to three

    cursor to thrombosis and That Was Then

    traced back to the inoculation

    also nerve pain and pins and needles
    
    75
    00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,920
    nobody believed me then I was dismissed

    as mentally ill
    
    77
    00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,840
    I was always told it's nothing
    
    78
    00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,720
    measurable but they did do a biopsy of
    
    79
    00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,120
    my nerve tissue and I hope that with all

    down to being just in the mind that when

    thousands of genetic variations in their

    had a covet 19.
    
    289
    00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,620
    I remember it was in 2021 and it was a
    
    290
    00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,660
    Wednesday
    
    291
    00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,820
    I was working and everything was fine
    
    292
    00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,060
    until the evening
    
    293
    00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,680
    that's when I started to feel as if I
    
    294
    00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,880
    had the flu
    
    295
    00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,000
    I had difficulty breathing difficulty in
    
    296
    00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,760
    breathing so I went to a private clinic
    
    297
    00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,139
    to get tested
    
    298
    00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,079
    when I told them my symptoms
    
    299
    00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,120
    they first decided to do a covet test
    
    300
    00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,560
    and when the results came in I was
    
    301
    00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,240
    positive
    
    302
    00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,199
    I was shocked
    
    303
    00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,240
    my eldest son was living with me because
    
    304
    00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,560
    he was studying in Nairobi
    
    305
    00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,019
    so he also had to get tested fortunately
    
    306
    00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:03,120
    his was negative
    
    307
    00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,399
    I considered checking into a quarantine
    
    308
    00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:07,740
    hotel but my son would be left alone at
    
    309
    00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,500
    home it was so challenging in the end I
    
    310
    00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,540
    stayed at home and we wore our masks
    
    311
    00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,100
    every day
    
    312
    00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,680
    but I wasn't able to sleep at night
    
    313
    00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,959
    I used to stay awake because I was
    
    314
    00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,420
    afraid that if I fell asleep I would die
    
    315
    00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,519
    well I thought I would go forever
    
    316
    00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,279
    after two weeks I went back for another
    
    317
    00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:29,120
    test and luckily I was negative
    
    318
    00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,120
    since having covered I've been dealing
    
    319
    00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,920
    with health problems that I didn't have
    
    320
    00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,639
    before up to now
    
    321

    00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,100
    in college and my daughter is still in
    
    326
    00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,260

    very hard
    
    329

    334
    00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,699
    cases if you compare when people were

    not wearing masks to know when people

    are you see the infection rate has gone

    repeated covid-19 infections
    
    348
    00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:54,779
    remember back in the early days of the
    
    349
    00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:57,839
    pandemic when having and getting over
    
    350
    00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,899
    about with covid-19 at least was thought
    
    351
    00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:03,860
    to have a big upside which was that

    survivors for the most part at least

    felt
    
    354
    00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,959
    protect it afterwards kind of like the
    
    355
    00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:13,500
    way I remember feeling after getting my
    
    356
    00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,619
    second dose of vaccine and and then my
    
    357
    00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,380
    third dose of vaccine but now that we're
    
    358
    00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,699
    all swimming in what's being called
    
    359
    00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:27,540
    variant soup that idea no longer really
    
    360
    00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,660
    holds water I personally know many
    
    361
    00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,240
    people including a couple in my own

    it three times
    
    365
    00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,419
    that shouldn't actually come as a huge
    
    366
    00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:45,559
    surprise I mean after all the four
    
    367
    00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:48,140
    coronaviruses that generally cause
    
    368
    00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,200
    cold-like symptoms are able to infect us
    
    369
    00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,039
    multiple times throughout our lives so
    
    370
    00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,679
    reinfections are certainly possible but
    
    371

    how often will they happen in the future
    
    372

    well covid-19 become seasonal like flu
    
    373
    00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,799
    that seems likely though we don't know
    
    374
    00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:10,880
    how long exactly that process will take
    
    375
    00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,940
    Health authorities do mostly agree that
    
    376
    00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,280
    otherwise healthy people who recover
    
    377
    00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,480
    from covid-19 are generally at low risk
    
    378
    00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,940
    of getting it again for at least a few
    
    379
    00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:27,299
    months but each person is going to have
    
    380
    00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:29,940
    a different immunological history with a
    
    381
    00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,059
    disease so it's impossible to really
    
    382
    00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:37,020
    predict your individual risk and if
    
    383
    00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:40,020
    immune evasion turns out to happen in
    
    384

    different ways with different
    
    385
    00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:44,340
    sub-variants experts say you can't
    
    386
    00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,080
    really rule out possibly getting
    
    387

    infected by them even in Fairly short

    wrench into what we thought we knew
    
    391
    00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,700
    because they're super infectious and

    00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,919
    several look like they're better at
    
    393
    00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,100
    evading immunity than earlier versions
    
    394
    00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,740
    of the virus and and Omicron also
    
    395
    00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,080
    continues to mutate at a pretty fast
    
    396
    00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,799
    pace that ability the experts say could
    
    397
    00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:17,940
    easily cause numbers to to spike pretty

    00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,860
    it guards a family's most treasured
    
    431
    00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,220
    feelings
    
    432
    00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:01,380
    the rooftops became the base for the
    
    433
    00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,900
    project cine Plata Banda launched in the
    
    434
    00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,700
    first months of the pandemic it used
    
    435
    00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,740
    Outdoor Cinema to relieve residents
    
    436
    00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,140
    confined to their homes
    
    437
    00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,120
    the events have continued beyond the
    
    438
    00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,700
    quarantines and lockdowns and expanded
    
    439
    00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,880
    to include live music more than 200
    
    440
    00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,220
    screenings have now been held with
    
    441
    00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,260
    several scheduled each month
    
    442
    00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,299
    the project was a reaction to the
    
    443
    00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:26,780
    increased level of violence and suicide
    
    444
    00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,880
    experienced during the pandemic the
    
    445
    00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,400
    Project's co-organizer and Jimmy's twin
    
    446
    00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,500
    brother Jaime explains the program
    
    447
    00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,659
    there are children films and documentary
    
    448
    00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:42,780
    films one important film which deals
    
    449
    00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:46,400
    with the fight against oppression
    
    450
    00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:51,059
    this is for a population that is living
    
    451
    00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:53,940
    through trauma and going through the
    
    452
    00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,880
    process of mourning and sadness
    
    453
    00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,059
    also the scars left by Venezuelan social
    
    454
    00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:01,580
    situation
    
    455
    00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:05,640
    all of that was projected into our Plata
    
    456
    00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,400
    Banda cinema screen which was welcomed
    
    457
    00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,159
    by the community had generated awareness
    
    458
    00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:16,679
    what's the level of violence was reduced
    
    459
    00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:19,260
    as the film ends residents flashed their
    
    460
    00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,480
    lights to applaud and not only for the
    
    461
    00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,700
    entertainment they are grateful for the
    
    462
    00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,440
    connections the rooftop events have
    
    463
    00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,799
    created
    
    464
    00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,500
    sometimes there may be events which I
    
    465
    00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,720
    can't see from my house
    
    466
    00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,400
    we speak with our neighbors who are
    
    467
    00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,419
    watching
    
    468
    00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:38,280
    and we move to their house and sit
    
    469
    00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,740
    together because they have a big balcony
    
    470
    00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,980
    with a good view
    
    471
    00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:46,500
    we already knew each other but now we
    
    472
    00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,039
    share more
    
    473
    00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:52,260
    this rooftop project allows us to share
    
    474
    00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:55,580
    more have more contact
    
    475
    00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:59,900
    and now we're more integrated
    
    476
    00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,240
    the pandemic intensified the social
    
    477
    00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,299
    problems which have plagued potato gangs
    
    478
    00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:11,400
    used the lockdown to step up criminal
    
    479
    00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,720
    activity
    
    480

    dangerous place became even more
    
    482
    00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,280
    insecure through Sydney plattabanda the
    
    483
    00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,860
    community reclaimed public space the
    
    484
    00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,780
    organizers say their initiative showed
    
    485
    00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,059
    patari's residence how to take action
    
    486
    00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:30,860
    where Public Services fail
    
    487
    00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:34,700
    I aspired to see violence reduced
    
    488
    00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,220
    is the only way if they're adding People

    future
    
    493
    00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,720
    we aspire to have a more Humane

    496
    00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,580
    useful
    
    497
    00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,500
